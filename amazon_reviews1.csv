B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,This is NOT a Budget Laptop!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2019","This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.",5.0 out of 5 stars,David Fisher,"4,702 people found this helpful",Verified Purchase,1,1
B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,"Great laptop, great price","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2024","I love my laptop. I don't game and it's likely not for that.  Office apps and my web blog,  not to mention pictures.  It's fast and easily connects to wifi.  It starts quickly.  It's lightweight for carrying.  I love the screen and keyboard.  It's not touch screen but that is fine.  The charge seems to stay for quite a long time.  So glad I purchased it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Shannon,21 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1
B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Great performance and quality for the price!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2024","I am not a gamer, nor did I purchase this laptop for gaming apps.  Yet, it is a very solid performing laptop for my needs with good ram and storage for the price.  The battery life is extremely impressive, and the laptop is as light as a feather!!!  The sound quality is much better with headphones.  I only wish I would have purchased a model with a slightly bigger screen.  This laptop is a great bang for the buck!!!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Edward,4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1
B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Excellent Laptop!! HIGHLY Recommend!!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2020","This is going to be a long and detailed review! Prior to purchasing this laptop, I did a tremendous amount of research so I know how important reviews are, as they helped me make my final decision. In order to help reviewers, I will say up front that I am not a gamer. I am a proofreader/copy editor, spend a lot of time on computers for internet research, including youtube work, and at any given time I have about 7-10 windows open and my computer is THEE primary source/focus of my work. I've had this Acer since mid-August. I waited to write my review in order to see how it performed for a couple of months, as some of the reviews I initially read did the same and I found that to be really helpful.My 12-year-old SONY Vaio ""died"" this summer and I found myself in a position of needing a new laptop but also needing to be really budget conscious due to COVID job constraints. I read over 131 Amazon reviews of this Acer, read two other independent consumer review sites (PC Magazine, Tech World), and asked some tech people in my world what they thought.  This laptop came out in the top three for quality for the price. The price was $359 when I put it in my cart. I waited ONE MORE DAY and that was ONE DAY TOO LONG and by the next day, the laptop was no longer available by Amazon, only from independent Marketplace sellers. I contacted Amazon who could not tell me when/if the Acer would be in stock again. The NEXT day, I read that the Acer would NOT be restocked by Amazon. So I didn't wait and bought it from the Marketplace for $460. Grr.... BUT!!! I am TOALLY PLEASED and happy that I got it when I did. Please note that this Acer IS back on Amazon and you can buy it for less. What a deal.The advice of many reviewers was perfect for my set up. I actually took notes and in the end, set up was incredibly simple and pain-free, and performance has been fantastic. I literally have NO complaints.Based on reviews, I purchased an extra 4G memory stick. ($20) Know what? I still haven't installed it!! I keep forgetting. AND IT HASN'T MADE A DIFFERENCE. To that end, based on reviews, I decided that I would purchase additonal hard drive, but I haven't gotten around to that. Honestly, I may not purchase it at all because I have an external hard drive and I have cloud space. I'm content with knowing that I have the option if I want to purchase more hard drive space if I want. So I have NOT yet had the experience of removing the back of the laptop to install more memory or hard drive. There are plenty of youtube vids that will guide you through the process should you need to do this and I will install the additional memory. Maybe after writing this.Almost no one wants ""S"" mode. There are a few protocols for switching out of ""S"" mode. Here's what I did: I plugged the laptop in, and it began set up. VERY QUICK SET UP. It will automatically be in ""S"" mode: 1. open settings 2. go to ""update & security"" 3. In the ""switch to"" win home or win pro section, select ""go to store."" If you see ""update your edition of windows"" section, do NOT click the ""go to store"" that appears there. 4. Once in the store, you should see a ""switch out of S mode"" or some kind of similar message. Select ""get"". You should get a confirmation message that you've been switched out. SIMPLE and QUICK procedure. I read that some people had trouble with this, but it was a snap for me.List of what I did in total:1. Took out of box, plugged it in. Set up began.2. Got out of ""S"" mode.3. Got rid of a lot of bloatware.4. Downloaded Google Chrome.5. Downloaded Avast Premium Security6. Downloaded Office 3657. Downloaded iTunesEven with all of that, this computer is FAST and as mentioned, I still haven't added additional memory.Powering up/down takes seconds. SECONDS.Navigation is super fast.The computer itself feels solid and I haven't experienced anything with the touchpad that feels chincy or flimsy, as some reviewers noted. . I know what some reviews mean by the bottom corners of the touch pad feeling 'loose'. What it is, is that there are no 'buttons' on the touchpad for ""left or right mouse"" and the lower corners are a tad ""floaty"", as they need to be able to depress independently. I don't use the touchpad a lot, I prefer a desktop mouse, so this doesn't matter to me.The keyboard backlight is great and I've checked with Acer and there's no way to extend the length of time it stays on. It stays on for about 30 secs. This is not an issue for me, as it's on long enough for me to orient myself on the keyboard if it's dark, and then I'm good to go. When typing steadily, the keyboard stays on steadily. Note: one of my cats walked across the keyboard and 'turned off' the backlight. I found that by hitting ""FN + F8"" and holding for 10 secs, you can turn the backlight back on.I LOVE the keyboard. The keyboard feels both solid and smooth. I'm a typist so the ""feel"" of a keyboard and typing is very important to me. My fingers fly over this keyboard! The letters appearing as I type appear to be flowing as words form.The little numeric pad to the right is great. Yes, the keys are a little smaller, so larger fingers may not care for this, but it's great when doing a lot of numeric work. I also love that the ""backspace"" button is larger- not like some keyboards I've had when it's the same size as a letter key.Odd that there's no light showing ""Caps Lock On""- other reviewers have noted this. Nor is there a ""Num Lock"" light, but that doesn't really interfere with my work. It just takes a moment to figure out what's going on if I accidentally leave the Caps Lock on.The power button isn't a hard press button like I've been used to. It's a ""key"", which is interesting.The sound is a big topic on reviews. I've found the sound to be a little low on volume, but it's been ok for youtube vids. Plus, I like using headphones, which make this a non-issue. I've examined the sound settings and done what reviewers have suggested to augment the sound. One reviewer spoke of switching from ""music"" to ""gaming"" mode to increase overall volume, but I haven't even found the setting to do that. No matter, I'm ok with the way it is.The picture/screen is fantastic. Clear and sharp!USB ports-- there are enough for me. I will be purchasing a dvd reader/writer, as this laptop does not have that feature, which makes it lighter and slimmer. In researching dvd drives, I've found highly reviewed ones for around $20. Very reasonable.I have NOT tested battery life yet. I generally keep the laptop in one spot and keep it plugged in. Also, the battery in my SONY Vaio died 2 yrs into owning it and I never replaced it so I'm not even used to moving my laptop around and using a battery. The one time I DID bring this laptop into another room, the battery lasted at least the four hours I had the laptop open.All in all, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this laptop. I've loaded it up and used it CONSTANTLY for two months, haven't installed extra memory yet, and it hasn't given me ONE SECOND of regret or ""hmm"" or concern. It looks great, it's fast, it's light weight, and it can be built up to serve your computer needs. Do NOT worry about ""S"" mode, that's an easy thing to let go of. I have no doubt this laptop will last me years and will serve my needs admirably. If anything else comes up as I continue to use it, I'll be sure to update my review! Despite paying more than what Amazon is currently selling it for, it was STILL a deal. I literally have no complaints at all. I recommend registering it and keeping note of Acer's toll free number in case you need support.Good luck and enjoy! It's a great purchase!UPDATE: It's nearly one year since I've been using this Acer laptop and I STILL love it. It has not given me one second of issue or regret. I ended up installing my additional memory after I posted my review but I haven't purchased additional hard drive. I've loaded a LOT more software and apps and it's still fast, crisp and spot on. One of the best purchases ever!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Tator Tot,"1,370 people found this helpful",Verified Purchase,1,1
B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Great work computer for a great price,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024","I have had a Acer Chromebook since 2019 and have needed to upgrade for awhile. I recently got a new remote job that pretty much forced me to upgrade since the Chromebook had 2GB of RAM and almost no storage.This Acer has been great for the past month. I was looking for something with at least 8GB RAM and 256 or more memory. The speed of this computer has been wonderful. I can have multiple tabs going at once and have had no issues thus far. I have not loved Windows operating systems in the past, but this one isn't too bad. Once you get rid of Microsoft edge and use Google Chrome, it was back to business as usual for me. Perfect size for me, lightweight and easy to travel. The protective case it came with was a small, but nice bonus as well.Battery life hasn't been tested too specifically yet but I have easily worked for 3-4 hours off the charger and have had plenty of battery left. So I think it's going to be just fine in that regard.I've been told I can probably do some gaming with this computer but I haven't tried that yet, as I much rather use my PS5. All in all, this computer is plenty powerful for what I need. Zoom calls, research, multiple tabs open, Slack, ClickUp (productivity apps).Highly recommend at this price point.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mackenzie,3 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1
B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,All you need in a computer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2020","First, I would like to say to ignore the negative reviews from the people who are saying that you can not switch this laptop out of Windows 10 S Mode. You can indeed switch this laptop out of Windows 10 S Mode IF you follow the correct instructions on the website. It will bring you to a page in the Microsoft Store where it will say to get Windows 10 Home. It will NOT ask you to purchase Windows 10 Home.Now that that is out of the way, on to the review of this laptop. After fighting with a Chromebook with Microsoft Office I decided that I needed a cheap windows laptop that way I would be able to type on the actual desktop version of Word.This first thing I would like to mention is the amazing screen quality for the cost of this computer. When you are watching Hulu, YouTube, Netflix, or any other streaming services the screen is clear and the picture is beautiful.The ability to have a backlit keyboard on a budget laptop is an excellent edition and is extremely helpful for using the laptop in a darkly lit room. The keyboard is also fairly nice to type on. I am someone who does a lot of typing and I have no issues at all with the keyboard.The variety of ports, especially nowadays, is an nice touch. Try going dongle free with a high end computer such as a MacBook. This laptop comes with two USB 2.0 ports, one USB 3.0 port, an HDMI port, an Ethernet port, and a headphone jack. I will say that if you do need USB C or you need an SD card reader then you would need a dongle for that but if you are like me and use neither then you are good to go dongle free.The ability to upgrade both the RAM and the storage is an excellent edition. I would highly recommend bumping up the RAM to at least 8GBs as this would allow the computer to run just a little more smoothly. An extra 4GBs of RAM is not expensive (only around $20).This laptop doesn't have a touch screen so if you need a touch screen you may need to look at other options, though I personally think a touch screen in a laptop is pointless.I can say that, though you won't be running high end AAA games at a high resolution or high graphics, you can get certain games to run quite well on the laptop. I can run Sims 4 at the highest graphics settings without any issues and this computer is great as a secondary laptop if you do have a primary desktop PC for gaming. Steam streaming works well with it.The only downside that I have found with this laptop is the battery life, which can get fairly poor depending on what you are doing. This doesn't really affect me too much as I am usually near a power outlet when I need it.I can't really tell you too much about how it would do with photo editing or with video editing as I don't really do that sort of thing but if you need a computer for school work, web browsing, writing, media consumption then this computer is really all that you need.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Crystal,13 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1
B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Bang for your Buck... but two minor issues,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2021","This is my first laptop, so keep in mind that I know nothing about laptops.However, I got this laptop for animation purposes. A creative whim to see if OpenToonz is as great as two hundred Youtubers swear it is.I was worried that it might not be able to handle such complex programs, since it is in fact a budget laptop, but I was pleasantly surprised. Not only does it effectively run OpenToonz, it also handles rendering in Blender and other programs that I thought might be too much for its processing capacity. I've played a few high resolution games on it without any issues, as well.I saw another review from a wonderful human being who knows a lot more about computers than me, and he left in depth instructions on how to turn off S Mode as well as how to upgrade your computer with a couple additional parts to expand its memory and processing. I did not utilize any of those recommendations (yet) and the laptop works amazing!It's got super fast internet, downloads everything quickly, amazing resolution, and like I said, it can handle some pretty tough programs. Some of my friends can't run blender on their own laptops, so that speaks for itself.Still, there are two issues I've found so far.Issue 1, the most obvious:The volume on this laptop is crap. It can be sitting right in front of your face and not be loud enough for you to hear the quieter sounds in a video. This is easy to fix with a speaker, so it's not a big deal, but I'd recommend getting a speaker at the same time you get the laptop just to avoid the disappointment when movie time comes around.Issue 2:It overheats very very VERY easily. Don't set this laptop on any blankets or pillows, or anything other than a hard surface.I noticed quickly that it gets warm basically as soon as you set it down on your lap, so I've been pretty careful about that. But just earlier today, I fell asleep with it on my lap (oops) and when I woke up about an hour later, it was off. It would not turn on. The charging light was blue, meaning that it was charging properly from the cord. When I pressed the power button, however, the power light flashed blue one time very briefly but the laptop didn't even try to turn on. No fans, no clicks, nothing. I waited an hour and tried again, but it still wouldn't turn on. Needless to say, I was horrified!If this happens to you, please don't panic, it's very easy to fix.Windows laptops have this handy dandy feature where they shut themselves off if they're at risk of overheating, to prevent any damage from happening. They also prevent themselves from being turned back on, apparently, but you can fix it in three easy steps.1: Unplug your computer from the power cord.2: Flip the computer over, and use a needle to press and hold the battery reset button located on the bottom for 5 seconds.3: Wait ten full minutes, plug in your computer, and turn it on.Mine booted up instantly when I did that, and I was deeply grateful for the feature that saved my laptop from my own relentless stupidity.With that said, this is a fantastic laptop and it works great, but there are two purchases you should make right off the bat: buy a speaker/headphones, and buy a cooling pad. I also highly recommend buying a mouse; the track pad isn't bad or anything- mine works as well as any track pad I've ever used- but computers are always better with a mouse ;DIf you're considering this laptop, I'd say go for it. Just make sure that if you're buying it for a kid or anyone who has a habit of laying in bed with the laptop in their lap, you get them a cooling pad. Windows will probably prevent it from being damaged from overheating, but you can spare them the panic of a laptop that won't turn on and the struggle of finding a needle that fits the reset hole.Happy browsing, everyone!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Audrie,45 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1
B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,I really don't know who this is supposed to be made for,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2021","Okay, so full disclosure.  I'm a computer repair technician and I bought the base model (Ryzen 3 w/4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD).  As a technician (meaning someone who can upgrade and repair computers), I'd give this a 3.5/5.  As an end user however, I really don't know who this is supposed to be made for.  It's woefully underpowered and comes with a crippled OS.  If you don't mind those things then there are a lot of cheaper options.  If you DO mind those things then I hope you know what you're doing because it's going to take a LOT of time and effort to get this thing usable.First off, S mode.  It's basically a Chromebook in S mode.  Again, you can get a Chromebook (or even another S mode device) for much cheaper than this so I don't know why you'd choose this one.  Putting that aside however, most people say that you can just get out of S mode and you'll have a normal computer, right?  Well, in THEORY that's true.  In practice however, Windows 10S likes to randomly and inexplicably revert to S mode without warning.  As a technician I see these S mode computers all the time that have reverted back to S mode with no way to go back to Windows 10 Home except to do a complete wipe and reload of the OS.  If you want to PERMANENTLY get out of S Mode, you have to get out of S mode, then download a copy of Windows 10 from the Microsoft website and make a USB flash drive with Windows 10.  Then you have to open up the flash drive, go into the Sources folder and add an ei.cfg file with the following parameters:[EditionID]Home[Channel]RetailOnce you do that you can boot from the flash drive, erase the drive, and install Windows 10 Home from scratch.  If you don't add the ei.cfg file it will just reinstall Windows 10S again.  This is not something a normal end user would be able to do, but it's necessary if you want to be able to feel secure that the thing isn't going to just randomly revert back to S mode and become unusable.Secondly, the specs.  4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD?  Seriously, Acer?  The last time 4GB of RAM was standard on laptops was like 2012.  I could see if this were a $150 computer, but at $366 it should have at LEAST 8GB of RAM and a 250GB SSD.  I upgraded mine to 8GB of RAM, a 500GB NVMe SSD, and a 2TB 2.5"" hard drive.  It's been close to a decade since I've personally owned a computer with a hard drive but it's nice to have that ability.  I also appreciate the fact that they include the mounting hardware and even the screws in a separate bag.Third, the screen.  The screen is okay, but there's a major flaw that took me a while to figure out.  The screen will dim if you unplug the charger and run it on battery.  That's normal, right?  Well what's NOT normal is that AMD has a setting called ""Vari-Bright.""  If this is turned on and you unplug the computer, the display doesn't just dim but it also loses contrast/color.  It's hard to describe it but it looks like crap.  Unfortunately the AMD Radeon software doesn't get installed through Windows Update and it's not on Acer's website so you have to go directly to AMD in order to download it.  Unfortunately that also means that AMD is going to install the latest drivers on your device, which haven't been tested and certified compatible by Acer.  Chances are it will be fine, but it's always best to use the latest driver from the computer manufacturer (in this case, Acer) rather than going to the chip manufacturer.  There are a million and one potential compatibility problems with new drivers, which is why they need to be tested by the manufacturer, who may update other drivers to compensate.  This isn't possible if you want to turn off ""Vari-Bright"" because you're forced to install the latest drivers from AMD.The next problem is with the keyboard backlight.  It turns off after 30 seconds and it won't turn back on again if you move the mouse.  You MUST touch a key on the keyboard to turn it on again.  There's a setting in the BIOS to disable the keyboard backlight timeout, but it doesn't have any effect.  Speaking of which, this computer shipped with an older BIOS revision (1.10).  I upgraded to the latest BIOS revision (1.11) but it didn't fix the keyboard backlight timeout problem.  Looking online it seems that a LOT of people are having this problem and not only with this model of Acer.  Apparently, Acer doesn't care about this problem.  I almost want to return it for this reason, but I really need another computer so I guess I'll keep it.  If I hadn't been able to resolve the screen brightness problem this would have been going back.The final issue is the battery life.  If all you're doing is reading articles this MIGHT be able to get you 4 hours of battery life.  If you're watching videos or you have a lot of stuff open, you'll be lucky to get 2-3 hours.  I mean, all manufactures overestimate their battery life to make their products look good, but this laptop doesn't last much longer than my 10 year old HP.In conclusion, I stand by my initial statement.  I truly don't know who this computer is for.  If you add the cost of the base computer ($366), plus the 500GB SSD ($60), the RAM ($45), and the 2TB hard drive ($80), you're left with a total cost of $551, and there are a lot better computers out there at that price point.  There's an 11th gen i5 15"" HP laptop on here for $599 with over TWICE the processing power, a 250GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM.  It also has space for a secondary hard drive if you need to upgrade that in the future.  If you're okay with an underpowered laptop (4GB RAM, small SSD) with a crippled OS (Windows 10S) you can get one for $150 and save yourself $200.I mean, I wouldn't call this thing a ""nice"" laptop.  It only has a single USB 3 port (the other two, including the one on the RIGHT side are USB 2.0 - that's right, a technology that debut in April of 2000 which means it's even older than Windows XP!).  It feels cheap/flimsy.  Battery life is mediocre.  It's basically a disposable laptop at a non-disposable price.  If this laptop was $150 - $200 I wouldn't be so critical of it, but whether you're looking for a cheap Chromebook type laptop or you want a real laptop that you can upgrade yourself, you can do so much better by going with something else.  I'm only keeping it because I've put so much time and effort into it and it's easier than returning it and starting over.The only person I can see that this would be suited for would be someone with a very limited budget that wants to be able to upgrade it over time vs. spending the $550 upfront.  But if they knew how to do all this computer stuff, chances are they'd have a better income and therefore a higher budget.  Maybe a student or someone just entering the workforce?  I dunno.I must say though, I'm really liking having a secondary drive in a laptop again.  It helps if I need to wipe it out because I don't have to worry about backing up the data since it's on the second hard drive.  But again, there are other computers with this capability.  If you can afford it, the $599 HP with the 11th gen i5 is a great buy.  I haven't personally purchased that computer but after doing all this, I wish I had.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Austin,209 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1
B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Better with a couple of upgrades but works OK out of the box,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020","Aspire 5 with 4gb RAM 128gb PCIe NVMe SSD drive notes (long, so you may want to skip this review):Aluminum cover, plastic housing.Left side ports - Ethernet cable, HDMI, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, Headphone jack.Right side ports - Kensington computer lock port, USB 2.0.Notably missing - no port for SD cards at all.Not a touch screen, but nice in color and clarity. (Opinions on screens and keyboards tend to vary widely - what suits me perfectly may seem to be junk to you, so YMMV).The speakers on the front underside - the sound is O.K. (for an inexpensive laptop) but volume is lacking.Power supplied through a proprietary Acer plug, not through a USB-C port.  Cord can only attach to the laptop on the left side (as seen by the user at the keyboard).Windows ""S"" is installed; it is limited to running apps available only in the Microsoft Store.Suggested upgrade - move up to Windows 10 Home.  It's a free upgrade - with the caveat that you cannot return to ""S"" version.To upgrade to Home version (instructions as of the date of this review; I assume/accept no responsibility if things go awry.  You may want to Google instructions to verify):Go to Settings.Then select Update & Security.In the left sidebar, click Activation.Then click “Go to the Store.”Press the “Get” button under the “Switch out of S Mode” section and in a very short time you'll be assigned the Windows Home version.Suggested upgrade - if you want to encrypt your laptop you may want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise.  These upgrades are not free, check Microsoft for current pricing.The Aspire 5 has a TPM chip so encryption will not require a boot password (not your Windows password).If you want to set a boot password for the computer (not your Windows password) you can set that in BIOS.  Don't forget it - resetting a boot password on a laptop can be a pain and a half (or impossible) to rectify.  See below on how to get into BIOS.The included 128GB PCIe NVMe SSD drive is (for me) large enough to hold Windows 10 Enterprise and the applications I use and is quick enough to run them. I'm in I.T. support (although semi-retired) and don't use the Aspire 5 for computer games. YMMV.Suggested upgrade - add an additional SSD to the computer (screws are in the box, housing and cable required are inside the Aspire 5).  You can Google videos on how to perform the upgrade.  A second internal drive allows you to separate your data from your operating system and applications; if Windows ever has to be completely re-installed your data won't be affected.  If you keep your data in the Cloud you can set the second drive as the sync drive and not fill up “C:” drive.The chip, an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U, does pretty well for my purposes.  Again, gamers may have a different opinion so YMMV. I've had no issues when viewing training or YouTube videos.The battery life won't get me through a typical support day without at least some recharge time - Acer claims up to 7 1/2 hours but, of course, that depends on what you're doing.  Watching videos will eat more power than writing a project proposal in Word.  YMMV, but I bought a second power cord to take with me to client offices while leaving the cord  at my home office plugged in. I seem to be getting 5 hours, maybe a bit better, with the screen set to maximum brightness.The machine doesn't get overly warm in use (again, I'm not a gamer), but I use a laptop board most of the time when the laptop isn't on a hard surface, so there is nearly always some airflow under the machine.The included 4gb of included RAM is really the absolute minimum to think about with Windows 10.Suggested upgrade - add a single 4gb RAM chip in the empty slot (Google for videos on that) to bring the total to 8gb RAM. After installing the additional 4gb the computer will report 8gb installed with ""5.94gb usable"".  The 'missing' RAM is being commandeered by the Radeon software for the display.  If you need/want more the machine can support up to 32gb (1 16gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed).  16gb would require 1 8gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed.  For business purposes (Office, Chrome and You Tube videos) I'm finding the 8gb (5.94 available) to be acceptable.  YMMV.How 'easy' the RAM and hard drive upgrades are depends on how comfortable you are working with computers.  I found them quite simple.  Be careful not to crack the plastic housing when removing the bottom cover.  Using the correct plastic spudge is helpful, you can search Amazon for a selection of tools. (spudge = type of plastic or rubber pry bar).  Google the ‘how-to’ videos first.""Bloatware"" included with the computer isn't completely over-the-top, but it does take a few minutes to delete all of the junk.  The ""Microsoft Office"" included with the Aspire 5 is a 30-day trial version, not a full license.After uninstalling the bloatware I installed Microsoft Office365 with Access, Adobe Photoshop Elements, DIA (a program for diagramming), AllwaySync (a backup program), Google Chrome, Splashtop Business and Personal (remote access software), VLC Media Player and a couple of network utility applications.  I have 78gb of free space left on ""C"" drive.The three small stickers showing Ryzen chip, Aspire 5 inclusions, and Radeon graphic chip that are stuck onto the hand rest part of the computer can be easily peeled off and leave no residue (I was able to rub the remaining adhesive off easily with my thumb).  I don't know why the stickers are there - presumably if you've bought the machine you know what the details are without seeing sticky notes on the keyboard surface.  If they're for advertising purposes in the store it might be more cost effective to print advertising to be placed by the machine rather than label every machine on the production line.  I also found the ""Full 1080 HD"" sticker on the screen bezel easy to take off.  So I did.  If Acer is interested in putting relevant data on stickers, how about putting the Make, Exact Model Number, Serial Number, and Date of Manufacture on a sticker?  THAT one I would leave in place.  As it is you need to flip the machine upside down to see the manufacturer's information.  (Sorry - this is a pet peeve of mine).A couple of quick notes for those who are new to Windows laptops - if the keyboard fails to light up, check the F8 key - it can toggle the light on/off.  If you suddenly lose your WiFi connection check the F2 key - that toggles ""Airplane Mode"" on/off.  Note that the ""function"" keys are set to use the little icons (F1 is sleep, F9 is mute, etc.).  To use them as traditional function keys you need to hold down the ""Fn"" key simultaneously.  Fn+F9, for instance, will cause the Outlook application to re-sync when you've got that desktop app open.  If you prefer the traditional function key usage (not having to hold down the Fn key to use the keys within applications) you can toggle that in BIOS.  To get into BIOS, reboot the computer and immediately start tapping the F2 key (no Fn key required).For me the 'sweet spot' of laptops is in the 14"" range (11"" for road trips).  That being acknowledged I don't find the extra width or weight of the Aspire 5 to be onerous - the thin screen bezel allows the claim to the 15.6"" screen while not unduly expanding the overall size of the laptop.  At nearly 4 pounds it's a bit heavier than the under-three-pounds-sweetness that I prefer but it's not too bad.  Especially after removing the weight of those ridiculous stickers.  YMMV.If you need more power than this machine has, Acer does offer a similar package with upgrades to the Ryzen 5 chip, 8gb of RAM, and 250gb of hard drive space as well as some other goodies:https://www.amazon.com/Acer-A515-44-R41B-Hexa-Core-Processor-Graphics-dp-B087N4ZRXV/dp/B087N4ZRXV/ref=dp_ob_title_ceHTHRegards,Jim",5.0 out of 5 stars,Baroque Tossit,556 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1
B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,it is what it is.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2023","well i'm using it to write this review. so there's that. lol.bought this in march of 2020. one thing i never understood is when companies want you to write a review immediately after purchasing an item, and you haven't even had the opportunity to really use it, or put it through the paces.so any review you give would be a false one. cause if the item doesn't last was it worth it?so here we are. almost three years later. and yes it does work.one thing that i found rather annoying is that it has nothing on it.we live in this world of apps and more. this wasn't my first computer purchase. so imagine my chagrin when i opened it up to a fully blank screen with zero programs on it.we live in a world where these companies are about giving you less and less for more money. akin to going to the hairstylist, they want to charge you extra for washing your hair, which was an part of the package, AND a requirement in getting your hair done.the same with this. now they want you to pay for the computer PLUS all of the apps separately. and they call it progress. you'd think with that being the case it would be faster. nope.you have to constantly reboot it just to get the web browsers to work properly. as you're using it the screens will change and fade out on you to safe mode. sometimes it freezes and you don't know why.the constant notifications about microsoft updates are a nuisance.does it still work like it did when i bought it? yes it does. but i have to be mindful of programs i attempt to use on it. because i'll get an error message that there isn't enough storage to run the programs on the hard drive. smh.this claimed to have the ability to use multiple applications and do split screens and more. well you can have the apps up at the same time. but good luck passing back and forth between them. i can't use anything from the adobe suite. because there's not enough ram.the few programs i loaded on it all have issues of usage and it tells of space and storage issues. ""slowing it down"" when the apps are open.and that microsoft store is not it. that's the biggest issue of all. you're pretty confined to the usage of ""apps' that they offer UNLESS you download a whole other program that basically works on top of the microsoft. which is a nuisance and yet another reason to not purchase this.if this is the way of life of computer purchases where you have to download a google app just to put programs on a computer that you'll use. when they USED to work well with and for microsoft years ago... just nope. why should we have to deal with these complications.before it was about making a cell phone like a computer. but now they're trying to make computers like cell phones. and this is one place where it just ain't premium and not working.i hate it. the programs i need and use i can't take advantage of. the stuff i don't want or need are here. they're good for pushing microsoft programs on you. but if you're in this world you know that microsoft doesn't excel at all types of needs involving a computer.  so be aware when you're buying this if you purchase it.also it's so old now that i would say it's not even worth the money they're charging for it. upgrade yourself and get something that will be worth your money.yes they have chromebooks where work from a google mainframe. but they're no better either. because they don't allow you to add on whole programs that you may need either. it's like you can't seem to win these days when buying a computer.just be aware when you're making a purchase. pay attention to the ram. pay attention to the storage space. the number of usb outlets. those do matter. this has three. and i use them all.oh one other thing. last year in 2022 the cord malfunctioned and stopped working to charge it up. so i had to purchase a replacement. which doesn't even fit well. but it does charge it up. so there's that i just have to be mindful if i'm plugged in and the new plug doesn't drop out.so yes it still works. the battery life, not so good roughly a good 2-3 hours of usage out of it, even this many years after the fact. but then i rarely use it without the plug, because i've found that most laptops don't work as well without a plug. and all claim to have a long battery life, until you put them to the test.not being plugged in you don't get full usage of the applications as you'd like. everything slows down. something i don't like. even the web browsers tend to struggle more when it's not plugged in.the sound from the speakers is midrange. not great but not poor. there are things i'd prefer to be louder. but you deal. it's not a touchscreen. but i didn't need it to be one.i paid $343 for this back in 2020. that it's now a few dollars more if it were purchased new today, AND IT'S OLD AND OUTDATED says much to me. this thing needs to be way cheaper given what you get and don't get. it's basically two steps from being obsolete.screen resolution is okay. and to be honest. i bought an acer. cause i've purchased from the name brands that charge more and received a mediocre product. so i figured if i were to get something that was not premium, i didn't want to pay a premium price for it.in the end people are going to spend their money how they choose. so if you want it do it. get it. but i wouldn't.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Cocoa Sunshine,187 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1
B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,"Easily 5 stars for the range of laptops it's supposed to be in. * Update, still 5 stars. *","Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2020","This is considered a budget computer, but for us computer geeks, this is the base for several ""premium"" models. I can't really write a review of the computer out of the box because before I ever turned it on, I installed a 2nd RAM card, then when I booted it, I signed into my account which changed it from Windows 10 S mode to Windows 10 Pro since I have several Windows 10 Pro product keys associated with my account.With that being said, this computer outperforms what it is meant to do. Is this going to be the strongest computer you can buy? No, not at all. However, this computer has edited large videos for me in minutes, I can use my music notation software on it with no lag or freezing (Sibelius), and it does actually process games at the higher resolutions. I've tested games as demanding as Forza Horizon 4 and it, surprisingly, performs with no issues. It does run hotter, of course, but not exactly ""hot"". Heavier usage draws down the battery, but that can be said for literally any electronic device.I purchased this to replace my well-aged HP G60 whatever model that was that I purchased 12 years ago and just kept updating. Up until around July 2020, it was still up to specs to work from home, something I actually bought that computer for 12 years ago. Finally, an update to most of the work at home platforms finally rendered that old beast useless. Ironically, I used the stimulus check from back then (2008) to purchase that computer. With that laptop in mind, I premium laptop to me is one that I can upgrade and repair easily. The HP G60 line did that quite well. Now here in 2020, I purchased one of these for someone else at first. During setup, I noticed the slot to add another SSD, I added the second RAM chip for that one as well since I already knew about that, but I also noticed how easy it was to work on it. We booted it up, put a Windows 10 Pro key on it as well, and from the start, I was impressed with the performance. I was so impressed that I bought myself one.This thing is super lightweight. The keyboard does have slight smaller keys which takes all of about 20 seconds to get used to. This is because it fit a full number pad on the right of the main keyboard, something that is a must for me with a laptop. One thing I absolutely don't find at this price range is the backlit keyboard.Spoiler alert: with the backlight turned on for the keyboard, your battery time can be reduced by as much as 50%. You really don't need it if you're used to typing on pretty much any keyboard, but it's nice when you do need it at night in the middle of a shift. The button to turn it on and off is located pretty much at the center of the top row (F keys). Just to the left of that is the button to turn off the track pad. Very nice placement on both of those.The graphics seems to use a combination of resources that gives you 5 GB reserved just for graphics processing. Not bad at all. This must be what pushes it to be able to do a lot more than expected for this price.It's nice going into the Microsoft Store to check the system requirements on games (Halo series, Forza Horizon, etc) and not see any red indicating the computer doesn't meet the requirements.For working from home, this is excellent for those resources that might require a proprietary desktop that you have to load and run via USB. It also has a built in ethernet port, which is usually required for those particular work from home platforms, but it also performs flawlessly on the 5 GHz wifi networks for the rest.As a digital nomad, I also have to upload and edit and create videos. This thing surprisingly gets through Adobe and other applications with ease and renders videos quite fast.This was supposed to be a quick purchase for me to replace my aged out HP and then I'd get another good laptop later on, but I'm probably just going to buy a couple more of these.*Update*I've noticed two things that improved performance. First, I downloaded the full AMD Radeon Software (it comes with the ""lite"" version) and that opened up a lot of performance tweaks on both the cpu and gpu.Also, I'm noticing the battery time listed must be an overall average. When I'm just browsing, watching a few Youtube videos in the browser, and doing stuff like writing product reviews, with the brightness turned down to the lowest setting and with the backlit keyboard off, I seem to get between 9 and 10 hours of battery life from a full charge. Not sure if that's normal for this device, but it's what I keep noticing. Make sure you also turn off bluetooth and location and all that other stuff you're likely not using because those can draw the battery down quickly. When I have the brightness up, keyboard lights on, playing games with the Xbox controller connected via bluetooth, working (headset in, running work platform software), the battery time can be as low as 5 hours from a full charge.I don't allow any sleep or hibernate functions. Those tend to kill a hard drive. There's nothing I'm ever doing that can't just be saved so I can properly shut the computer down. Sleep and hibernate modes can also do some strange things to batteries, usually causing software glitches that can wreck even the best batteries. They can also cause data fragmentation... all in all, I just don't use those functions on any computer, and for all I know, it could contribute to the better luck I have with laptop batteries and having never had hard drive failure.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Non Stop Horizon,128 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,2,1

I bought this Acer. It comes with Microsoft S mode and Windows 11. Unlike other reviewers, I received only a 30 day trial of Microsoft 365. Apparently once you've accepted a previous offer of a 1 year Microsoft 365 trial in the recent past (that terrible Lenovo had this), Microsoft blocks you from getting another 1 year trial even if you purchase a new laptop.I loathe S mode (another way Microsoft tries to force you to use Bing and their inferior products) but I'm afraid that it will slow the computer down and so haven't turned it off. Bill Gates is a loser and Microsoft is really an awful company. I miss Google and no, Bing is not comparable. It's crap.Except for this, I am fine with it - for now.

B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Windows S[tupid]-Mode,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2024","The Short Story: Windows S-mode is stupidly impossible to turn off and Acer should be embarrassed to have this pre-installed on their machines.The Long Story: It was time for a new laptop. I have babied my little 4yo Lenovo Flex14 for as long as possible, but when the number row on the keyboard stopped working, I realized it was time. So I started researching laptops, trying to find one that had the most features for the best price. I read plenty about S-mode and read plenty of reviews that said that it was easy to turn S-mode off. And I read plenty of angry reviews from people that tried everything to get rid of S-mode and eventually returned it to Amazon. But that wouldn't happen to me. I was sure that the angry people must not have followed directions or were technologically impaired. So after much researching and comparing, I settled on this sweet little Acer. With the exception of not having a touchscreen, it ck'd all of my other boxes.I placed my order and anxiously tracked my delivery the next day, refreshing the Amazon order page every 5min. It finally arrived and I almost dropped it, I was so excited w anticipation. I opened the pkg, noting the Windows 11 sticker w S-mode instructions. Very few things smell better than a new laptop when you open the box. I plugged it in and powered it on. The screen was lovely. The keyboard keys were flatter than my Lenovo, but easy to use. The touchpad was very responsive. I went thru all of the steps to get it setup and patiently waited for it to go thru all of it's updates and finally, the moment of truth: turning off S-mode. I carefully followed the instructions on the box. I followed the instructions on the screen. I followed the FAQ instructions on the Windows page. I googled instructions and for 36hrs, I was obsessed w finding The Fix to turn this d*maned S-mode off. I lit some sage to clean it's aura. I recited healing scriptures over it. I watched so many YouTube videos, it messed up my algorithm and now I have plenty of How to Get Rid of S-mode on my feed. I almost called in a priest for an exorcism. I felt defeated and relegated myself to the Technologically Impaired side of the room. I started the refund/return process and I was packing it up, the last thing I saw was that stupid Windows 11 S-mode instruction sticker, mocking me, and I had the sudden urge to yeat the stupid box w it's stupid laptop and it's stupid S-mode out the window.So buyer beware: if you need to do anything that Uncle Bill hasn't approved of, you.are.screwed. At the very least, I just needed Citrix and Chrome installed to do my job. SO simple and yet, Uncle Bill and Microsoft deem them unworthy to be in their Microsoft Store. However, as a consolation prize, Microsoft was thrilled to let me know, via a pop-up box that I had to continually click out of, that I was eligible to download a variety of games *including Minecraft* via the The Store!! Eeeeeek!! How exciting!! I'm certain my employer would have been delighted to find out I was able to play Minecraft on my new laptop, but not the program that I actually needed for my job. Too bad cute little cartoon blocks can't pay the bills. :(Also... a word of caution... if you don't want S-mode, read thru every laptop description *thoroughly*. I was shocked at how many laptops had only Windows 11 listed in the Title/Heading, but when I read through the description, I would find that it was actually Windows 11 w S-mode. It was always the ones w lengthy descriptions listing all of it's FABULOUS features oh... and btw (last item mentioned), it has Windows 11 in S-mode. :-\",2.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,2,1

The only issue I have had recently is where the computer screen will black out and the entire computer will be non-responsive for a few seconds before rebooting. I think it probably has to do with visual memory or such, since there's not a whole lot of it and it's not usually much of an issue since it comes back with all the programs and such intact but I wouldn't recommend this laptop for gaming due to low visual memory.",4.0 out of 5 stars,C,,Verified Purchase,2,1

B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,"A Laptop So Nice, We Bought It Twice","Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2020","This year, both our old laptops gave up the ghost and we had to buy new ones. I first did research for my wife. She likes to move her laptop to various chairs around the house. Once online, connected to the world through WiFi, she looks up news and other things, checks her email, does banking, and watches a few videos. Sometimes we talk to family and friends on Skype. I know a lot more about computers than she does, so she asked me to find one for her. A touch-screen wasn't important, so I was looking for a thin, attractive, high-resolution screen laptop, with reasonable speed and a solid operating system. We've also tried tablets , but without a decent physical keyboard, found them lacking. The bonus was, judging by her needs, I didn't think we needed to break the bank to find a decent machine at the lower end of the scale. When we bought it, just a month ago at the time of this writing, the price was a hair under $350. Today, a quick review of the product page shows they've shoved that up by $70 to $420. Why?? I have to say, that might have been a deal-breaker.However, I did choose this Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop. It arrived and I went to work to set it up for her. It was pretty intuitive. Plug it in, press the power button, and follow the prompts. Easy. However, we like to use a lot of apps not made (or even approved) by Microsoft. The laptop comes with Windows 10 on it, in Microsoft's ""S"" mode. In other words, they set it up so you can only get Microsoft programs and apps that come from their online store. If that doesn't suit you, don't despair: you can opt out of that ""Microsoft-only"" mode during setup.For example, we like using the Opera browser, not M's ""Edge."" As soon as you try and download the program, Microsoft pop ups appear, all concerned: ""are you sure?"" ""Apps not approved by Microsoft may be dangerous -- may damage your computer."" And ""once you abandon S mode, you will not be able to get it back!"" Don't worry, go ahead and press the button. You'll still have Windows 10 and can choose apps from wherever you want them.I'm not going to go through the technical stuff in this review. You can read all about that on this product page. I'll just tell you, the laptop is attractive, light and thin, the screen is big enough for everything you want to do, including watching videos and movies, and it is in good resolution. It runs quietly, and its interface with WiFi and online webpages is good. The backlit keyboard is nicely laid out and easy to type on. You get 3 x USB ports, plus others. You get 4 gigs of working RAM, which may not sound like a lot, but it's plenty to handle watching videos etc. You get 128 gigs of memory on the harddrive -- again, not huge, but it is solid state, which means, dependable. And these days, it's so easy to add an external drive or get yourself a bunch of thumb drives which are now cheap - cheap - cheap. And of course, you can use Microsoft's One Drive (installed) or any other cloud memory service you prefer.My wife is happy with her Acer. And then, a couple of weeks after we got hers, my own laptop went down for the final count. I happen to do advanced video and photograph editing on two different desktops, a PC and a Mac for various applications. But I also like to use a laptop for much of the same things my wife does. My choice was even easier this time. I chose the same Acer we'd just acquired for her. Fortunately, I also got the $350 price, or we would have paid an extra $140 on our two purchases.In the meantime, we're enjoying our Acer laptops.

The Toshiba one was starting to show its age by failing to pass POST and thus failing to boot. I had used it almost every single day since 2012 after all, as it was my college laptop and even helped me launch my career as an engineer, so it has served me well. But the OS failures were getting troublesome. They were happening increasingly often, so I decided before all my data was lost (which wasn't really that much, since I keep all my actually important data on a home file server), I decided to shop around for a nice, reliable, not-too-cheap laptop I could use to replace it, and this is the one I chose to buy.For the non-Linux enthusiasts, feel free to skip this paragraph, but a kernel panic is basically the Windows blue screen of death equivalent on Linux. My old Toshiba was having kernel panics all the time starting with Kernel 5, so I thought maybe it was my old hardware which has having trouble with the brand new kernel. I tried an LTS version of Kernel 4.19, thinking it was going to solve my kernel panic issue, but nope. I still had kernel panics all the time, and it was starting to get worrying how often it was happening (multiple times a day near the time I got this new Acer laptop). So I feel like I got the new Acer laptop just in time before the Toshiba hardware became unbootable. Now, I'm an electrical engineer, but I'm a lazy engineer. I didn't feel like dissecting the Toshiba to try and pinpoint what the problem might have been. I use Arch btw (best meme 2k19)So back to regular English. I'm thoroughly impressed with the hardware that AMD has developed with their Ryzen lineup and their Vega graphics. Sadly, with all the cryptocurrency mining happening nowadays, it's actually hard to find any AMD graphics card for use with actual graphics workloads like gaming. But that's beside the point. This Acer laptop, with its Ryzen 3 processor and built-in Vega Picasso graphics is almost overkill for what I use it for. I haven't tested any games on it, but I imagine it would run Minecraft well enough. Maybe not 60fps, but still enough to play. I use this laptop mainly for just web browsing, and occasional coding when I'm feeling ambitious with some sort of personal software project I want to work on.In the time that I used Windows 10 S Mode... it was just plain dumb. Not being able to install software from non-Microsoft sources? Really, Microsoft? What are you doing? You can easily opt out of the S Mode crap, but it warns you that you'll never be able to go back to S Mode in the future if you ever change your mind. Like that'll scare me into keeping S Mode! I'll show you how much I care about S Mode. I only spent about a half hour tinkering with it before I just blasted the whole NVMe M.2 drive clean and installed good old Arch Linux on it with a fully encrypted filesystem, so ain't nobody getting into my data. And I can say, this NVMe M.2 drive is freaking lightning quick. Compared to the old HDD on my Toshiba, this new laptop boots in like 15 seconds, if even that. My main PC with Godly specs (Intel i9-9900K + RTX2080Super + 1TB Samsung NVMe M.2) boots in around 10 seconds, so this little laptop is definitely keeping up with the speed.Overall, this Acer laptop is a fantastic computer; probably the best laptop I've ever owned at this price point. It's perfect for basic usage, and I recommend it to be used for light workloads like checking email, browsing social media, editing office documents, coding, and other basic tasks of the sort. The Ryzen + Vega chip will definitely last several years, and I'm happy to finally support a quality AMD product. Ultimately, it's up to you as the customer to decide if this is the right computer for your needs. Evaluate why you need this computer and determine whether or not the price of this laptop would best suit your needs. I needed something I could rely on with streaming, decoding, and rendering video data from YouTube, Twitch, and/or Netflix which is actually a bigger task than people give it credit for. If you don't intend to watch many videos or do anything more resource-intensive than that, then this laptop might be a touch too powerful for your needs. With all that in mind, it's safe for me to say that this Acer laptop is perfect for the moderately light workloads I intend to use it for.",5.0 out of 5 stars,zzApotheosis,4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,3,1

B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Fantastic Laptop for the price - Easily Upgradeable.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2021","This laptop is a STEAL at the price offered. I nabbed the cheapest config for about $380 and spent $30 on a second 4gb memory stick. Just that is enough to make this value laptop better than most of the desktops in the office.I got this for work, and for D&D so I take it back and forth with me to and from work every day. It's not the slimmest or lightest laptop on the market, but it fits well in my bag and isn't a burden to carry about on the regular (though I'm a 90s kid, I grew up carrying a massive backpack loaded with 80lbs of massive textbooks and trapper keepers, this is nothing).I upgraded it to 8gb ram but I may actually upgrade again and swap the 4s out for 2 8s because it does struggle a little bit with my work load. I'm an estimator, so I need to have open several things at once including semi-graphic intensive programs for viewing/marking up very large architectural plans, google chrome in various tabs to search for the prices of things and access our office's project management site, and I'm constantly copying/moving/uploading/downloading large files. Outlook, calculator, note programs, etc.When opening programs I watch the CPU and Memory spike to 60-80%, but the CPU will eventually drop back down to lower % while the memory stays up in the 75-80% range. Sometimes when opening new programs the CPU spikes to 100% and that may be causing the slight lag I get, or when swapping between all these programs. Right now I have 7 programs open while I type this, and my CPU is at 8% and my Memory is at 74% so I think upgrading again, as well as eventually getting a larger drive will fix any such issues. But that is just me and my work load. 90% of the time it runs just fine.It's quiet, it does not get very hot, and rarely do I even hear the fans.It was extremely easy to unscrew and open the back and upgrade the ram. While in there I saw where to upgrade the drive so that will be easy too. So getting this for such a low price, making those two relatively inexpensive customizations, and you've got a better machine than most selling for twice as much.I love the keyboard. I am not one of those people who are obsessed with the clickety of a mechanical keyboard. I actually prefer this chicklet style and I like a bit more squish to my keys. I don't like to make a lot of noise when I type.A few other things I love - the keys are backlit when typing but shut off after a bit of inactivity. That's nice, especially if running it on battery. The screen is really nice and the colors are great as other reviews have said. I have a mouse plugged in so I don't often use the track pad but it works well and I like the size and placement of it.Now on to a couple of cons.First - the sleep key on the keyboard. It's probably a me issue and not really the laptops fault, but I am constantly accidently hitting this thing when I go to hit the 1 button instead. Constantly putting my laptop to sleep.Second - I love that it has a keypad, especially as I am crunching numbers all day. But I don't like the configuruation. I find it a little difficult to use and months in I still haven't quite gotten used to it. The numbers are fine but I often hit + when I mean to hit * or hit - when I need / and its just a minor frustration.All in all this is an amazing laptop, and can't be beat for this price. If you're on the fence, looking at other options at around this price range - stop looking and get this one. You won't regret it. I've suggested it to two coworkers and a friend and all 3 have gotten it and love it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dylan F.,27 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,3,1
B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Perhaps you need a tin can,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2021","I needed a laptop for simple, low-processor requirement tasks (i.e. I didn't need a gaming laptop), but by the same token, I know how the PC buying experience goes: you want as much processing power and speed as you can get, otherwise you'll just find yourself upgrading everything down the road.Admittedly, 4GB of ram wasn't ideal, but upon comparing this laptop with HP, Lenovo, Dell and others across every possible vendor (including Ebay), I am convinced the processing speed and features are an incredible deal for the money ($365 USD = Acer Aspire 5 w/ 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD hard drive). Other people suggested buying some additional RAM, and being spoiled w/ 32GB of it on my desktop, I definitely agreed, so I ordered an additional 4GB more (A-Tech 4GB RAM for Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop A515-43 | DDR4 2666MHz SODIMM PC4-21300 260-Pin CL19 1.2V Non-ECC Unbuffered Memory Upgrade Module) for $40 USD.I also believe more storage is essential. The Acer Aspire 5 comes with a slot for an additional SSD drive to supplement the 128GB drive, but here's where you have to carefully consider your options. You must look at sequential read and write speeds, where faster is always better. You also have to consider that you will likely have your operating system on the main (C:) drive.If I were to use the supplemental SSD slot, I would have to go with a SATA III type storage (looks like a very small, thin book). If I want much better speed for the price, I'll want to replace the 128GB ""C:"" drive with the same type (PCIe Gen3 8 Gb/s, looks more like a RAM stick). I went with the 1TB Crucial P5 (1TB 3D NAND NVMe Internal SSD, up to 3400MB/s - CT1000P5SSD8) for $120 USD. It's a pain to switch it out, because you have to make an 'image' (i.e. copy) of your C drive on some other storage device, then put that image onto the new SSD drive, but in the long run, it's worth it because you're coming out of the gate with much more storage and very likely (couldn't find specs on the Aspire hard drive) a much faster hard drive.So, $525 ( = $365 + $40 + $120) and you get:CPU 3.52 GHz8GB RAM1TB hard drive with up to 3400MB/s read speed and up to 3000MB/s write speed15 inch monitorunder 4lb SLIM laptopANDWindows 10.I call that an incredible deal.Now, I've read the comments about Windows 10 S. The myth is that you get locked into a system where you can only buy and install Microsoft software unless you want to shell out... man, what was it? Oh yeah, a trillion dollars. Well, turns out that's:FALSE!In fact, all you have to do is sign into your free Microsoft account, push a button and 'boom', you're off of Windows 10S and on Windows 10. No charge, no hassle, no anything. In fact, the laptop asks if you want to do this on setup, but either way, the instructions are easy to find with a Google search. Whoever wrote these other reviews apparently aren't familiar with Google searches. I can only wish them luck on their new journey to 'the internet' and beyond. I have no idea how they were able to buy this laptop or write a review.Regardless...It's true that you don't get Windows 10 Pro and have to shell out a few bucks for it ($99 at the time I'm posting, 10 March 2021), but most people don't need it unless they want to use MS OneDrive cloud storage (monthly subscription) or remote desktop. I use Google cloud (free) for some things and never log onto my laptop from another computer (i.e. remote desktop): I just take the laptop with me when I need it. Either way, Windows 10 comes free with this machine, you just have to switch it at the MS store, and that takes less than a minute.All that said, this laptop is just awesome.

I settled on this one after looking at reviews and once I got it started up I quickly realized that in order to download whatever apps you wanted onto it that were not Microsoft apps, you have to switch the computer out of S mode. I’m not a super techy person and I didn’t even know what S mode was, but I quickly googled it and realized that it is a freaking pain in the butt To switch out of. Microsoft makes it next to impossible to do this. After searching several online forums and trying multiple things that people suggested I finally was able to switch out of this mode and have the ability to download whatever apps I want. For example, the cricut app and chrome browser app cannot be downloaded while in s mode. All the time I spent trying to get out of S mode took probably three total hours. In my opinion this is an insanely stupid feature and had I known this computer came ith S mode or even what it was For that matter, I probably would’ve gone with a different one.

B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Great deal,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2020","I am a big fan of Chromebooks (which this isn't), but there were a few simple problems with integration to home networks.  There are work-arounds and dual booting and dealing with developer mode.  When a recent cheap Chromebook died, I looked for a replacement, but either the work arounds were really slow, or the Chromebooks recommended specifically for that purpose were super expensive.  Then I came across this (again, it is not a chromebook), and figured I'd just install Linux on it and use it for web browsing and connecting to various services on my home network.It worked flawlessly.  The supplied SSD Hard Drive is somewhat small (plenty of room if you do most of your work in the cloud though), but they do supply a mounting kit and if you need it a YouTube video for how to install a larger drive in the computer.  One slightly disappointing thing is that I had a few 1 TB SSDs sitting around, and the plan was to toss one in the laptop and reclaim the 128 GB SSD to use in an enclosure as a USB drive to transfer files/hold a dev env between work and home and support for various friends.  The included 128GB drive is just the chip on a board and doesn't look easily removable, and wouldn't mount in any of my enclosures even if I could remove it.  So, adding a large disk just adds another drive in the OS, it doesn't replace the one it comes with.That actually isn't a big deal as it saved me the hassle of virtualizing the included Windows 10 installation to run on a VM if I ever needed Windows.  After a few false starts where it didn't look like you could boot off of anything but the included SSD (turns out, disabling FastStart in the BIOS lets it book off of a USB key), I was able to verify everything worked fine off a live CD image on USB and it can now just dual boot into windows or linux seamlessly.The memory is a bit tight, and while I was getting everything installed and configured I'd get random pauses.  Adding an 8GB memory stick (easily accessible, especially if you are upgrading the drive and have the cover off already - it just has 10 normal phillips screws, no special tools required) solved that, although I did spend a few days just surfing the web on the laptop and using remote ssh into the home network, and after the initial installation and configuration I rarely saw any problems  while waiting for the memory to arrive.So, for about $22 extra dollars for the RAM, I now have a pretty speedy computer with a nice display, full number pad to the right of the keyboard, much more capable than the Chromebook it replaced for about the same price.  My original plan was to just use it as a web browser and an ssh client into my desktop to do development work on the couch, but it turns out my dev tool chain works perfectly fine on the laptop.  It is slightly slower doing a full compile of projects than the desktop, but that is to be expected, and I don't get any network lags doing thing remotely.  I don't really notice any difference while actually coding or doing small write/compile/test cycles.The only real negative for me so far is that for a new laptop (the manufacture date on the sticker says Oct 2019, but it has to have been designed before that), it still has a specialized charger.  I've got much older laptops that use USB-C charging.  So, that is one more cable on the desktop, one more adapter to move from room to room, one more specialized piece of equipment that will need to be replaced if it goes bad.But, for the price, it isn't a speed demon, but I don't play games except on consoles and with very minor upgrades it works as well as any other PC laptop I've used.  I'm not a Windows guy, but I did use it long enough to switch it from Windows 10 Home S which comes pre-installed to Windows 10 Home (the main difference being you aren't tied to the MS store for application installation , as far as I can tell).  I did install some software and used it and it felt as snappy as any of my work laptops (although, that could be damning with faint praise).",4.0 out of 5 stars,Troy Tanzer,5 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,4,1

B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,"Not Great, but Decent Enough","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2024","My second ever Acer laptop. I had a small one in my younger years, and that thing struggle quite a long. This laptop is pretty much better in all it’s way, but that because of today technology. Honestly speaking, this laptop isn’t that great, but it’s good enough for what I need it for, which is good enough for me. For $300, and even less on sales. You can do some light office/college/business work, light browsing, and very very light gaming on low setting. Unless it’s an old MMO, you could probably get away with medium or higher, but don’t expect much. This thing may have “8” gb ram, but in honesty. You’re probably going to have around 3.5-4gb ram free, as window system will eat majority of it. My biggest complaint is that you can’t upgrade the ram, it’s sadly soldered on. Unlike the storage, which is upgradable, but do know you’ll have to reinstall window. The casing feels “light”, very light, enough to where to I don’t want to apply too much pressure as it might deform or bent it in a way, maybe cheap material. The display is….. uh do able? It’s very dim and the color is like off, very off, don’t expect to do any artsy stuff with correct colors. As for battery, it leaves a lot to be desire. Depending on what you’re doing you could be around 2-7hr battery life, so make sure to always keep it plugged in. The keyboard is fine, it’s nice to have a laptop with the side pad, it’s something I use for when I do light gaming. Other than, it’s a pretty all rounder budget laptop for a cheap price.

B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Awesome machine with terrible UEFI options,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2019","This is a Christmas gift for my child and I've been playing around with it for a couple of weeks to get everything the way I want (changing terrible Windows 10 default settings, installing parental control software, cleaning up start menu, removing bloatware, etc).  I consider myself an ""advanced basic"" user as I don't work in tech but I've built a couple of rigs and usually upgrade and replace components in my own PCs.  Anyhow, bought this with the intention of making the following changes (so my review is based on the laptop in this configuration): swap S-mode for regular Windows 10 (free and easy but irreversible), install an additional 4 gigs of RAM for a total of 8 installed, tweak settings as mentioned before.Almost everything about this machine is amazing, and for the price I don't believe a better deal can be had.  It puts my husband's budget laptop to shame.  The SSD is quiet and smooth, the monitor display is beautiful, it can stream and handle basic tasks without any lag at all, and the ports are totally sufficient.  The keys feel excellent (plus backlighting!), the brushed aluminum case top looks very stylish, and the speakers are totally sufficient for a laptop (if you want great sound quality use headphones).  The AMD Ryzen processors are very good and this will typically outperform the slightly higher priced model with the Intel i3.  Windows 10 is Windows 10, but it's better than S-mode.  The hard drive capacity is quite small and if this were for me as a primary computer I'd want more storage space, but if this is for a child or not your primary computer it might not even be noticed.I was, and still am, super impressed, but one glaring deficiency of this laptop is the motherboard control, specifically in how it lets you see/access/change UEFI firmware settings.  Thought it was an ASUS for some reason but I'm unsure of manufacturer as it's not specified in UEFI and there's just a Chinese name on the mobo (it's not listed in windows device specs either; I'll probably have to download Speccy or some such).  Apparently it's common for laptops to have a limited UEFI/BIOS compared to PCs, but the items you can change here are basically nil.  You can disable fast boot and see/do a few things like that, but forget memory or graphics settings.  If I'd known this, I'd probably still have bought it, but I'd have planned my RAM purchase more carefully and factored in the higher cost of upgrading the machine.Windows sets aside memory for some things like paging (virtual memory, but changing this had no effect on usable RAM), other OS tasks, and for sharing with the onboard graphics card, and that combined with some default mobo settings means your installed RAM will not always be your usable RAM, as is easily seen in system settings (assuming your RAM stick is working, compatible, and installed correctly).  For instance, on this laptop I now have 5.94 gigs usable out of 8 gigs installed.  UEFI correctly shows the 8192 mb installed but won't let me tweak memory remapping or virtually anything at all, and as I've tried everything outside BIOS setting tweaking to increase the usable RAM without success, I'm basically out of luck, having paid for a good 4 gig stick to get a 2 gig upgrade.  Anyhoo, if I'd known this in advance I'd have planned to get two 8 gig sticks and may still do so at some point in the future, but it's highly irritating that this mobo will not allow settings changes to fully utilize your hardware.  I'm not trying to overclock, ffs.Hopefully this helps anyone who's looking at this laptop with plans to upgrade the memory (and possibly the HD).  All in all, I would still highly recommend it for so many reasons, just know you may be spending a bit more on RAM than you'd planned.

B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Won't be wrong at this price,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2019","A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,H. C. L.

B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Out of the blue .,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2019","What at first sight caught my attention was the design of this laptop, minimalist to put it in some way, having it in my hands because I am not disappointed at all, the build quality is good for a laptop of this price (I acquired it  for $ 309.99 dollars), the touchpad is of a considerable size because it allows you to navigate freely and the gestures, are quite intuitive, the bad thing that you notice is that you click manually (if you prefer since it is better to do it through the configuration of two fingers  ) The touchpad is perceived loose, cleaning it shows as if it moved to the sides.  The keyboard is magnificent, the position of the keys is just what you need, the noise it makes when you type it is not annoying, it has lighting which helps you a lot when using it in low light, it is programmed to turn off if you do not use it  which is good if you are watching a movie, reading or watching videos on YouTube.  The screen is very good, to be honest I was very surprised, its quality is quite clear the colors are not appreciated false or over saturated, the image quality it offers is something that will fascinate you outdoors because you have to look for a good angle of that  shape will not be affected, the brightness is decent if you want to lower it to a minimum and when you choose to upload it to the maximum you will appreciate the clear images without perceiving that feeling of discomfort.  In terms of performance I can not add much, of course the programs I use because I do not consider them something that requires too much resources from the processor, it is worth mentioning that I chose the laptop with an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U Dual-Core Processor 2.6GHz.  I consider it a laptop for normal day-to-day use, to perform tasks in Excel, to do documents, to browse the web, are things that make them very easily the solid state disk (128 SSD) allows you to open programs with  very easily, even with the basic specifications you will have a very good performance and speed, I have installed Autocad 3D which is the program that I normally have installed on my MacBook Pro and it turns out that it runs without any complications.  Windows 10 version S is installed at the factory.The audio is quite good for the price of the laptop, the music is clear but do not expect to have a serious and powerful sound I will only tell you that it is good, what I disliked was the fact when I put the laptop on my legs or on the surface  From my bed the audio is compromised. The battery life I would put about 5 hours with a medium intensive use.Summing up if what you are looking for is a PC that has a good performance and speed for basic day-to-day use in current standards, because this is your option, if you are looking for something more professional then you will have to look at more options that offer you higher  specifications, at least I use it for personal use and I am very happy with its performance, I have not installed any games so I can not give you a review about its behavior in games.Switching out of S mode in windows 10On your PC running Windows 10 in S mode, open Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home or Switch to Windows 10 Pro section, select Go to the Store. (If you also see an ""Upgrade your edition of Windows"" section, be careful not to click the ""Go to the Store"" link that appears there.)On the Switch out of S mode (or similar) page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button. After you see a confirmation message on the page, you'll be able to install apps from outside of the Microsoft Store.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Johnny Tezz,12 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,6,1

But I wanted a backlit keyboard (woo hoo) without paying $1,000 and decent memory to play simple computer games.  This cost about $100 more than I wanted to spend too.My $250 -- approx 9 month old Dell is JUNK. The key letters wore off at about month 5, and after the 1st update, it lacked memory for the 2nd Windows UPDATE.  The Dell website did NOT disclose that it was OUTDATED MODEL.So I came to Amazon, because I could look at the top 40 selling list and see what other people, based on their knowledge and research, were purchasing.  THAT IS HOW I SELECTED THIS LAP TOP.Out of the box -- plug it in, plugged into my ethernet cable1st challenge -- turn off Microsoft S Setting so I could install programs NOT in MS store2nd challenge -- junk programs that I did NOT ask for -- remove xbox and MS Office, etc.3rd irritation -- stickers on the panel near touch screen & keypad left STICKY STUFF right where my wrist rests.  I imagine rubbing alcohol may damage the paint so it may take me MONTHS to remove this sticker mess residue. MAJOR IRRITATIONSet up -- out of box set up, plugged into ethernet -- took roughly 10 to 20 minutes -- but I'm not a techie and I needed to find my Windows account information and passwords to add my Google Mail.  So if you have existing MS Account get that from your settings on MS Edge / Explorer before you begin. Ditto for Apple account etc.Speed -- wow so much nicer than the comparable priced OUT of date Dell that I've had the past yearKeyboard -- love the back light ( BIG ^5) AND it is farther apart on keys but I'm adjusting.  I thought I'd not like the 10 key on end but I don't notice it.Updates -- so far no major Windows Updates have been neededFirst impression, I am very pleased. It will take a few weeks to get all the settings like my old computer and get all the account passwords transferred to this computer. I thought when I logged onto my Google Account that it would do that -- maybe I've missed that step.INTERNET SUGGESTION FOR SET UP -- Be sure to give your computer a UNIQUE DEVICE NAME on your internet service provider as you set that up.  My technical support advised me yesterday that was potentially one of my problems that I was having FYI.NOTE - WHY CABLE VERSUS WIRELESS -- I used ethernet cable so did not do wireless at ALL on the set up.  There are 20 modems with 5G within reach of this laptop -- it weakens the signal for me to use wireless inside my apartment per Sparklight technical support.UPDATE July 5th -- I keep loosing the SOUND -- I've reset the settings 3 times already to restore the SOUND -- this is why Microsoft should not be a monopoly (Update#3 so far, now the sound is here all the time YEAH ME)UPDATE Dec -- the ethernet  / folding socket has a ""spring"" to expand it for the cord, right? so... it is annoying as the dickens to be in the middle of being on line and the CORD COMES UNCLICKED so EASILY!! I am replacing my cord and upgrading it -- but just FYI that feature seems to be a defective design flaw.

This laptop never advertised a touchscreen so there was no misleading information.*** This is a beautiful laptop, easy to use with a big, gorgeous screen. The updates were actually fairly quick, it connected to the internet with no problems. The only real thing I dislike is the fact that I got this laptop for school, and it came with Microsoft preinstalled, but I can't use it. It's been very frustrating trying to open it and get it installed especially since I have a subscription. I can only use the browser version, it's a bit counterproductive for convenience. I've been trying to troubleshoot and install it for over an hour now. On another note, the sound quality is good but the volume is pretty average even on max volume so using headphones would be best. Video is flawless and the browser is great! It holds a decent charge for at least 8 hours and the fan is so quiet, I literally didn't notice it. It's easy to navigate and use and basic user friendly. I say basic because I know there are a lot of people who like to really dig into their electronics and boost and enhance their stuff but I'm not one of those super tech savvy people.

B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Wonderful Laptop That Won't Break the Bank,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2019","I rarely review products but figured this may be helpful to some. For starters, some background context: I am in my mid-20s and have long since finished uni. I am not a gamer. I primarily use my laptop(s)/tablets for streaming shows/movies; occasionally working from home; and crafting/design editing. I used to go through every iteration of a MacBook but, while nice, soon found myself not really utilizing all of its features & could no longer justify its price-point (especially since I do still have an iPhone).This laptop is a STEAL for ~$300. I did my research and honestly, like a majority of the other reviews here said, the Acer Aspire 5 blows every other product in its price bracket out of the water. That said, I went into this fully knowing I wanted an inexpensive laptop and that, because of that constraint, whatever I ended up purchasing would most likely have some limitations. If you purchased this and are disappointed about the specs in correlation to it being ~$300.... I really don't know what to tell you other than that you definitely were looking in the wrong place.I solely bought this computer because I recently got a CRICUT Explore Air 2 and needed something compatible with it (Chromebooks won't work and my MacBook is so old it can barely handle the newest OS); however, I already know now that this is going to become my main laptop and I will get a lot of use from it outside of just crafting.THE IMPORTANT STUFF:1.) This is a solidly-built laptop. Very sturdy, very lightweight. Perfect for on-the-go. It IS aluminum though the whole way around, so I recommend buying a case or sleeve to avoid scratching.2.) The screen resolution and sound quality is surprising very good, crisp, and clean - while I think perhaps it could be a tad bit brighter, that's just me being nit-picky. I would still recommend using external speakers if you want to retain the quality of sound at its loudest setting, especially if what you listen to is bass-heavy.3.) Turning off Windows S-Mode was absolutely painless - it's literally just going to the website that's taped on the outside of the box and clicking one or two buttons.4.) Like other reviewers recommended, I did purchase another 8GB of RAM and installed it myself (I googled YouTube videos on how to do this for this specific laptop model; there are plenty of them, just take it slow and you'll be fine). I opted to leave IN the 4GB stick that was already there, thus giving myself a total of 12GB RAM. The difference in speed is HUGE and, like I said, I'm not using this for *too* much other than everyday use. Spend that little bit of extra money if you can, I promise it's worth it! I can't speak to anything as to whether it would hold-up with gaming, but definitely for a solid several hours of streaming content, crafting, and/or having multiple tabs & apps open simultaneously.5.) The track-pad is VERY sensitive. Not so much so that I would take off a star, but enough to notice. I recommend purchasing a wireless mouse if you plan on doing more intricate work to eliminate any annoyance or mistakes. I bought one (a Logitech one, $10) and so far it's definitely made designing and editing much easier.It's been awhile since I've had a PC but it's nice to know that a lot of its shortcomings (such as memory space & speed) can easily be fixed and modified to your preference. Again, at the end of the day, this is NOT a heavyweight laptop, both literally and figuratively speaking, but that's okay because it's not meant to be! Overall, I would highly recommend this computer to anyone who is looking for an everyday laptop that is both budget-friendly without sacrificing too much of its quality.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kelley,92 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,9,1

B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Still holding strong,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2023","purchased the Acer Aspire 5 Slim laptop, and overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase. The affordable price point was a major selling point, and the laptop has exceeded my expectations in many ways.**Pros:**1. **Affordable Price:** One of the standout features of this laptop is its budget-friendly price. It's a fantastic option for those looking for solid performance without breaking the bank.2. **Sleek Design:** The slim and sleek design of the Acer Aspire 5 is aesthetically pleasing, making it a stylish choice for both work and leisure.3. **Decent Performance:** For everyday tasks and light productivity, this laptop performs admirably. I've been able to multitask, browse the internet, and use various applications without any noticeable lag.4. **Good Battery Life:** The battery life has been impressive, providing ample usage time on a single charge. This makes it convenient for on-the-go use.**Cons:**1. **Limited RAM:** The laptop's 4GB RAM may be a limiting factor for those who require more memory for demanding tasks. Upgrading the RAM would have been a welcome option, but unfortunately, it's not possible.2. **Non-Upgradable GPU:** Another drawback is the inability to upgrade the GPU. While it handles basic graphics tasks well, it might not meet the needs of users with more demanding graphical requirements.In conclusion, the Acer Aspire 5 Slim offers excellent value for its price. It's a reliable option for everyday use, but if you have more intensive computing needs, the limitations in RAM and GPU should be taken into consideration. Despite these drawbacks, I'm overall satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a budget-friendly laptop.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Cory,54 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,9,1
B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Good Value A 315,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024",If your looking for a lightwieght decent computer at a 300 price point this is it. Did my homework before purchasing both on amazon and tech sites. This model is advertised as having a backlit keyboard ...it does not which iKnew going in. Keyboard is easy to use. The display is decent have my charter spectrum app for tv and i do light gaming casino games ect.which it handles very well. If your a heavy gamer would recommend a gaming computer instead. The processor is lightining fast which is a plus everything loads very quickly. When using the ac charger make sure you push it all way in the port. You also have the ability for usb c charging if you choose that method. A usb c is not included however if your like most you probably have one in a drawer like we have. The battery life is okay depending on what your doing however almost all laptops tout longer battery life yet fall short.Set up mine using the 11s mode and tranferred my files and passwords over which was a breeze. Got rid of the bloatware and set up my privacy for no ad sharing ect. Set up was quick and easy. You can also opt out of windows 11s mode which is easy to do. Conclusion if your looking for a budget laptop without breaking the bank this is a pretty decent reliable name brand choice.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don,9 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,9,1
B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,Good working computer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2024","This computer works great for working and studing, somelight gaming is allowed in it with its configurations, however do not expect much performance with bigger AA games. It will be laggy or maitg not run at all. I tried running Warframe, and performs OK at low setting, with some stutter here and there. Also tried running grounded, also performs ok at lower settings. The games that run good are the pixel ones, like Stardew Valley and the Menssager. Those do great.This is for people that like to play some games like that, but mainly needed for work and study. It is super lightweight and charger is slim and light also.Sound is good (not great) and connectivity is good.If you want heavy games to perform well and still want to do productivity, I recommend the Asus TUF, you will have to carry a heavier computer, but it will run recent AA games at high graphics and still be able to do home work",5.0 out of 5 stars,Henrique Ellrich,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,9,1

B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,"Basic use, 4 GB ram is not enough, makes a good Linux VPN share laptop.","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023","I bought two of these laptops in the summer of 2020 for $299 and $310. The first thing I did was pull the stock memory and storage. I added 16 GB ram and put in 1 tb drives. I installed  Xubuntu Linux, later installed Debian Linux “bookworm” Release. with no driver issues. I added a USB 1 GB Ethernet adapter/hub combo to the 1 USB 3.1 port. This Laptop has a good screen and I like its lighted keyboard. Its Ryzen 3 3200U processor isn't fast, but its fast enough for my needs. I only use this laptop as a VPN internet share laptop for my work at home 2nd local area network. I could use an VPN router for this, but would get much slower internet speeds.  Using the laptop as an VPN share device I always get good internet speeds.  The second laptop I have as a backup, if the Linux OS gets a bad update and fails. It has happened 3 or 4 times where I had to use the backup laptop.  Minimal downtime that way. Always good to have a backup.The only thing I don't like about the laptop is that every so often I will get a blinking battery warning light. When that happens I unplug the ac power to the laptop and let the battery run down to 15%, then plug in the ac power to the laptop and good to go. No more warning light. I pull the bottom cover off once a year to clean the laptop and make sure the battery isn't showing signs of swelling. So far so good.  If that happened I would probably just pull the battery and run the laptop without a battery.  These laptops have been a good value for what I use them for. The laptop performs well running Linux, I would not be running windows on the laptop. I think its processor might be to slow for that. In its stock configuration 4 GB of ram would be a bad day for windows.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bob Reviews,34 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,10,1

B0BS4BP8FB,A315-24P-R7VH-Display-Quad-Core-Processor-Graphics,"A great value laptop with some tradeoffs, but well worth the price.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2020","Not going to go into the specs on this, but I'm going to say that I REALLY like this computer!Pros:1.  Full size keyboard with a number pad (I need this since I do a lot of work with Excel).2.  Backlit keyboard (I sometimes work in poorly lit areas and this works wonders).3.  Bluetooth (great for routing sound through my soundbar should I decide to do that in the future).4.  Not a touchscreen!  While some prefer them, I am going from a touchscreen laptop to a non-touchscreen laptop.  (I found it annoying that stray hairs or other things would cling to the screen and then I couldn't clean the screen off without opening 15 different things on my old one.  So, I was happy to find a laptop that didn't have that feature, which I do not miss at all.)5.  Long battery life (6+ hours--this is going to be great for car trips when the travel restrictions end).6.  Processor and memory are able to make instantaneous calculations on a 25 MB Excel sheet (which is unusually large).7.  Very lightweight (this is going to be fun when I go through airports again as I'm the Dad carrying two car seats along with the backpack of tech).8.  Not made in China!  If you're trying to boycott Chinese goods like I am because of Xi Jinping's lackluster response to COVID-19, rest assured that Acer is based out of Taiwan.Cons:1.  Windows 10 S-mode restricts you from third party programs like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.  If you want them, you have to permanently take your computer out of S-mode.2.  The processor fan is a bit louder than most others.  This sort of thing doesn't bother me, but it does bother my wife, who also has an Acer Aspire 5.3.  The processor fan also has a tendency to run while the laptop is closed.  I'm not sure why it needs to run while it's supposed to be idle, but oh well.  This is another thing that doesn't bother me, but it seems a bit odd.4.  The battery is not a removable module like other laptops' batteries.  If this is going to be a very long term solution like my last laptop (bought in 2013), I know I'm going to need to find a way to put in a new battery safely and without damaging the unit.5.  The speakers are a bit weak.  I discovered this one day when I lost my phone and needed to use it for distance learning school videos for my third grader.  I had it on full blast in a quiet room and it was difficult to understand at times.  (It was inspiration enough for me to get a nearby friend to call my phone so I could find it was kicked underneath the couch.)  If good quality speakers are important to you, this unit isn't for you.  For me, it doesn't matter because I can live without the Windows 10 sound effects and I don't use it for entertainment.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Paco Suave,3 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,10,1

It doesn't have a cd-rom drive, but you really don't need it since it streams shows and videos. The battery lasts all day, it doesn't lose power in a matter of hours, like other computers batteries.

B0BT46KQXQ,Dell-11-Chromebook-Processor-Super-Fast,For the money you can't beat it.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2024","I've had this for a week now, and I'm going to try to do my best to give a thorough review.Pros:- It came in great, impeccable condition, really, with the right charger and everything.- Awesome battery life- Comfortable keyboard- Easy to navigate (I used to have a decent windows HP but it got destroyed due to a water accident, so I wanted something cheap that works, primarily for creative writing. I have limited experience with Chromebooks, but this has been super easy to learn)- Even though this Chrombook comes on it's last update (see Cons), there are still plenty of helpful add-ons to be downloaded from the Play Store. For example, the voice recorder I downloaded (and internal mic of the chromebook) produces better sound quality than my moderately expensive HP- I like the sleek, all black design- It doesn't run hot or loudCons:- Wifi detection can be pretty weak, so make sure you have access to a strong wifi connection- Headphone jack seems to be a little worn out, so sometimes depending on how I move the chord, the sound quality in my headphones changes (this is probably a problem that is exclusive to my chromebook)- It is a tad slower overall than middle to high end laptops, but not unbearable- Since Chrome is on it's last update, you can't download crucial extensions like Adblock.Overall, for 62 dollars or something after taxes, this is an amazing laptop. Frankly, I love it, and all the cons are not deal breakers at all. I guess it also comes down to the quality of the individual Chromebook that is shipped to you, as I suspect some are in better condition than others, but if Amazon's inspection process has improved, then I would think that the odds of getting a dud are less and less.Bottom line: If you want a laptop that's good and cheap, this is perfect for browsing, watching videos, writing. It's a tad slower than your higher end laptops, but oh well. It's fantastic, really.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sean M. Hurley,18 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1

B0BT46KQXQ,Dell-11-Chromebook-Processor-Super-Fast,Adequate Computer!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023","I was in my last semester of college and my Apple MacBook that I had for YEARS finally broke, and Apple told me they were unable to fix it.I needed something just to last me my last semester (at least 4 months) that was inexpensive, but would be adequate enough to do all of my homework and college assignments on. If you’re looking for an inexpensive computer to do basic work on for a short amount of time, this is a wonderful option.The only negatives were 1. The computer was quite small 2. I ran into many problems connecting it to the internet. It allowed me to connect to my home internet and school internet, but wouldn’t let me connect to internet at Starbucks or at my boyfriends college when I went away. I tried to see if maybe there was a limit on the number of connections you could have, but that wasn’t the problem. It just was picky with the places it wanted to connect to. 3. The computer ran slow. It wasn’t so bad to the point where it was challenging to do work, but just enough that I was annoyed every now and then.Other than those few negatives, this computer was adequate for everything I needed in my last semester and I highly recommend if you are in a similar situation.",3.0 out of 5 stars,gabriel,3 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1

I ordered it late in the day, so I expected it to ship the next day but to my utter joy I received a message a couple hours later saying it shipped and would arrive by 10pm the next day. I was pretty excited that I would get it a full day before I expected. Once again though, my expectations were exceeded in the most wonderful way when I woke up to the notification that my package had been delivered. There was obvious care taken in the packaging to ensure that nothing could harm this refurbished beauty. I have to give props to the delivery peoples as well because the box it shipped in was even in pristine condition which tells me that from start to finish everyone involved in the handling of my purchase treated it like I imagine they would would their own.

B0BT46KQXQ,Dell-11-Chromebook-Processor-Super-Fast,Good Purchase,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2023",This refurbished Dell Chromebook was purchased to replace a small Chromebook that just wore out after 11 years.  I'd purchased a new Acer Chromebook which is fine but big... I wanted a small one for travel purposes.  If there is a mark on this machine I cannot see it.  Slightly dirty/dusty but easily cleaned in no time.  It appears that all functions work as they should to include the external drive ports.  The only thing that seems off is the sound which is very soft and hard to hear at the maximum setting.  I will be looking into this to see if I can increase it.  I would recommend a purchase from this vendor without hesitation.  One caution... the machine was not power washed so previous owner name and email address appeared at start up.  Easily erased to reset machine back to factory settings and all user info and local files removed.  Once reset reconnecting to make it 'my own' took just a couple of minutes.

B0CT98X2CV,HP-Essential-Business-i5-1135G7-Processor,Using this for DJing and portable EDM production,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2024","I use Serato with a dedicated Pioneer controller and Ableton for producing as well as a copy of FL Studio because it's still useful and it does everything I've needed it to do. There were a couple delayed track loads but nothing so bad that it ruined the mix. The setup was easy peasy and easy enough to get by the Microsoft account required nonsense.The graphics seem good altho the colors get pretty washed out when on the higher brightness settings. That said, I'm not a gamer so I can't confidently comment on the graphics card's power.The quality of the device is about par for the course for it's price range. I wouldn't be throwing it out of any helicopters but if it just sits on a desk or a stand and transported in a computer bag it'll be ok.The computer is larger than I thought it would be which is usually a good thing and is such in my situation. I've noticed 0 heat issues so far, even around the USB-C port. I've put a few hours of bare legs as a computer stand when producing use without any uncomfortable heat or sweating.It's worth the money for my needs and I would recommend it for any DJ use as well as light to moderate music production use but for the best performance it'd be best to stick to 1 CPU sucking software per machine.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jared,9 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1

I left it off for an hour or so, went to turn it back on, and it was just a black screen, fan ramping up, and no response to the mouse, keyboard, etc. An hour later, and it's still unresponsive and running the fan super hard.

Some of the professional requirements that relate to my navy reserve goals  require a computer equipped with a working cac card reader that will enable me to access certain online navy related sites for professional courses and other military related online training requirements. The good news: I was able to at least test drive going to at least the front page of  certain navy related sites easier than I thought it would be. Additionally, I was able to get into establishing a new hotmail account, signing into one of my gmail accounts and easily signing into the amazon account (that is connected to the review I am writing this on). The caveats: patience is necessary with this type of computer because I had noticed already logging on to some of the websites required some time.  Additionally, both my husband and I realized that I am obviously going to have to both eventually browse around and inquire both online and offline for help towards permanently installing the software necessary to access a multiple number of the required online navy sites with the cac card reader I already bought (for training and other requirements mandatory  for my navy reserve career).

I was confused at first of why, well here is why. Whenever she would try to use the computer microphone in games, it won’t pick her voice up at all. When it was time to play games online or even games she downloaded from the store, they become very choppy and hard to even control, the amount of time she has to sit through a loading screen would take up to 12 minutes, just for it to crash. Next is videos, the quality of the camera is….bad. Very bad. And not to mention when she is trying to watch movies or videos on the computer, they became very very lagged out. Now this girl only has 2 games installed, amazing Wi-Fi connection and still has a lot of memory left. But this computer just can’t get the job done for nothing when it comes to entertainment, schooling or even work. She said that most of this was already happening when she first turned it on and the buffering is insufferable. I wish I wouldn’t had waited until her birthday to even gift this to her but I had trusted the reviews. Wrong move to do I guess.

It is horrible. I know what your thinking. ""Wow those are great specs for so cheap"". Yeah the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" applies here. Massively.It is SO slow. May as well have 1g of ram. No setting optimization fixes this. NOTHING works properly. Everything is so buggy and crashes often. I bought this to run quickbooks for a business and my 85 year old book keeper was making fun of me for how slow it was and how I shouldn't have cheaped out and bought this POS.Yeah imagine an 80+ yr old man complaining about how slow a ""new"" computer is. It's that bad and worse.The screen is literally the worst screen I've ever seen in real life. Laptops 10+ years older have a screen that blows this away. It actually hurts my eyes after about 30 minutes and that's never happened to me before. It is so hard to look at.The whole thing is SUPER cheap. The keyboard layout is stupid and if you're used to a normal keyboard get ready to hit the wrong keys constantly.There is no redeeming quality to this laptop. It's absolutely garbage DO NOT BUY. It's probably not even worth the aggravation trying to get everything off of it and return, so the best I can hope for is some good karma put out in the universe saving some other poor souls the misfortune of buying this POS.Do not buy.

B0BQ9W4DV3,HP-15-Laptop-Processor-Super-Fast,"Laptop itself is nice enough, Windows isn’t","Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2024","This thing looks decent enough but it runs ridiculously slow. I had to remove McAfee for it to even run/load anything, and even now it’s really slow. It takes forever to get a tab to load. I can be sitting right next to my router and it will say I have one signal bar, sometimes randomly cutting to no signal. I think I need to go through my files piece by piece to try to decide why it’s so freaking slow, bc it’s not an old computer. I tried playing a game on it and the frame rate was abysmal and stuttery on a game that wasn’t using very many resources. (Pathetic for a laptop that has a self-proclaimed gaming mode.) I’m disappointed because I wanted to use this to write stories, manage my business, and play a few games, but I can barely build my website even sitting right next to my internet. I’ve tried turning off the WiFi of every device in the house and it still doesn’t catch the signal very well. I can’t use it in my room at all, even though my iPad has full bars in my room.When it does eventually get full signal, it works smoothly. I really wish that it came with more built in storage because the amount of it taken up by Windows files cuts it down to a quarter of its advertised storage. If you want something to play games on, I would take the time to invest in an *actual* gaming computer. Yeah, it will put you out a lot of money, but considering how much grief I’ve gone through to even get this thing set up, you’ll thank yourself in the long run if you just invest in a better machine. It doesn’t come with Microsoft Office or any word processor other than the notepad, so I had to download a different one. Basically everything that used to be nice about Windows computers has been locked behind a paywall. I’ve been using this for months and I can honestly say that I miss my old MacBook Pro, and if it wasn’t eight years old, I’d just go back to that.TL;DR—machine itself is nice, the mouse buttons are pleasant and the keys feel good. Windows OS is a bear to work with and I barely get a signal from my router 60% of the time. It’s bogged down by Windows files making it slow, and you have to uninstall the new safety mode to even do anything. If you were to uninstall Windows and use a different OS, it would be a very pleasant machine to work with in terms of ergonomics and functional feel. The graphics are pretty when they load, but I had to crank them all the way down to even get it to move (even then, having it be a crawl).Overall, I would only recommend this computer to someone that is a Windows acolyte. Or maybe someone that uses Linux for everything anyway. I miss my old laptop and wish I could get another one of those instead. :/",2.0 out of 5 stars,Ariel,4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,2,1

Now it’s only been taken in and out of the charging hole two or three times and it doesn’t want to stay in. On further inspection, the internal mechanism inside the cord that is a small wire that’s supposed to fit into where you charge your computer or where your computer gets power is slightly bent. This has been a problem since purchase but then again, I didn’t open the product for a month or two after I purchased it. so now it’s too late to get it repaired and I’ve only taken the charger cord in and out of the computer 3 to 4 times.

It feels great and comfortable on the fingers, tactile feel.. Trackpad is pretty good as well.. Took me a while to adapt due to coming from Apple beforehand and was searching for that command key for the longest haha, but the learning curve was fairly simple for me.  Good sound as well.  The display is not the best, but it's good for most people.  Feel as though it could be more vibrant.  Easy to start up and shut down, both are quick.

(VERY tough choice - but i have an old macbook air for now)3. i needed this machine for development, and like the nice tie in to windows onedrive, really gives me an easy way to manage my file repository.4. keyboard is good but i like beveled keys better (no backlight)5. overall great machine for the money, if you want all the bells and whistles you will be spending > 7-800 clams.  my reccomendation is that if you don't care about touchscreeen, get a macbook air 2024 for $850.6. nice screen size, i don't care about the image quality b/c i'm coding on this thing. its a great price b/c if it breaks, is stolen, etc, i can buy a new one. i would cry sweet tears if the macbook broke.note: this is NOT a gaming machine. if you want to game, get a console, its the best way to go. if you are a pc gamer you need to spend north of 1k to get anything decent.overall, one of the best in its class for barebones with good power. if you want bells and whistles, fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, touchscreen, etc, you'll have to spend more. i went for raw power and storage, with good screensize. it was a very tough choice over mac but i came up as a developer with windows and i'm going back. i like the mac shell but powershell cuts the mustard now.for $500 with windows pro, this is a great developer machine. very happy with it so far.giving it a 4/5.no comment on battery life yet... probably ok.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Benjamini (Orange Kat),30 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1

(I'll save the video editing for my XPS - which is waay too finicky (and pricy) to be hauled around).  Be forewarned, though.  The Levono V15 product description is misleading.  The only USB C port is also the only power source.  So, if you're planning on dedicating the USB C to higher-speed processes, think again.

B0CK9JSM3G,Lenovo-V15-Hexa-core-Processor-i7-1065G7,Functional but with some caveats,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","I bought the 16gb RAM, 1 TB storage model. Mine came with a barrel plug charger, some of the reviews I'm reading are for ones that came with Type-C charging.First with the pros. It's pretty much exactly what I needed in a laptop. It's light. It is well built, it feels very well made and solid. It's quiet and doesn't get too hot. The processor is pretty decent, that's why I bought this particular laptop actually. It's very responsive and not laggy at all.Now the cons. This thing earns its price tag. It has some decent internals but man did they ever cheap out in other areas. The web cam is pure junk, the one I bought on Amazon for $12 like five years ago looks better than the web cam on this laptop. The speakers are terrible, tiny trash. Luckily this thing has a headphone jack. The biggest con about this laptop though is the display. It's a freakin' TN panel! The colors are very washed out and the viewing angles are poor. When I'm typing on this computer at my desk, I find myself hunching over and getting very close to the screen because it's hard to make out. I can never seem to adjust it right, I need to really get in there to see it. Looking at the screen for too long will give me a headache. Luckily, this laptop has an HDMI port on the side, so I would recommend that anyone who buys this should invest in a monitor and a laptop dock for their home use. The display is just good enough for me to use when I'm out and about or sitting in class.I guess that some versions of this laptop have IPS panels. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't bother telling you that information. Therefore my second recommendation is to just buy this off of Lenovo's website or some other website that provides that information, not Amazon.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Zachary,34 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,2,1

B0CK9JSM3G,Lenovo-V15-Hexa-core-Processor-i7-1065G7,Initial reaction: Not impress and considering returning tbh,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2023","Looks nice. Feels nice. Keyboards nice. Only 2 usb ports, not a problem but feels like a downgrade in my experience. For some reason, the charger provider is a usb-c, I don't know why they didn't offer a typical AC charger but I'm no expert either so maybe there's a reason. The WORSE PART of this is that when I started this up, the screen is BADLY WASHED OUT. I'm trying to figure out a way to get rid of this weird affect it has on the screen. Maybe the drivers aren't fully updated, maybe I need to tinker around the display settings, I have no idea yet. My Acer laptop is much cheaper yet has a screen that looks way better from the very beginning.Update: I'm starting to think the problem is the screen itself, the colors are changing if I change the display settings but the white foggy cast on the screen is making the colors look really gray. The pixels are also easily visible if you change the angle of the laptop screen so if you look at it from a certain angle you can't see any of the colors at all. Overall, this appears to be a solid laptop for work and games, but the display is surprisingly horrible.

If the screen is of utmost importance to you, do not buy this machine. The 1080p is crisp enough but the color is not accurate out of the box. I'm not going to bother calibrating but the viewing angles are not great either so there's a good chance you'll have difficulty with content creation. It's best at full brightness, which also annihilates battery life.I'm not a gamer either to know whether the machine is fast enough for those tasks.What I can say is for a budget laptop with that's quick with lots of ram and storage, this is a good business machine. Unfortunately one way they kept the price down is having no keyboard backlight and minimal ports. You can get all that from the description and photos.I have a higher end laptop for production. It has an OLED 4k screen and it's even faster but I also paid more than 2x the price for it. I bought this one for one specific software related to diagnostics and repair on heavy duty trucks and it's more than enough for that.I actually find it more pleasant to use generally since it's a bit lighter.

I got this particular model because it had more core. The unfortunate thing is after trying to load it so many times and having difficulty with it I found out I only had seven months of warranty on it, and it was dispensed from the UK, maybe that is why I have so much difficulty with it, but I just can’t afford to lose time loading another computer, which Amazon customer service said I could do So I’m just struggling through with this, but I would not advise ordering it unless you live in the UK",2.0 out of 5 stars,Barbara B.,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,5,1

B0BL35XNF5,Acer-A115-32-C96U-Processor-Microsoft-Subscription,Fast pc that feels like a Chromebook but with the functionality of Windows 11,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2023","I bought this laptop for writing and taking online classes primarily, and it's just perfect.  Keyboard is nice to use.  Screen is bright and crisp.  Laptop is lightweight.This is NOT a laptop for gaming, video editing, demanding graphics work, and you're probably going to get frustrated if you are a busy, multi-tasker with multiple software and dozens of browser tabs open at the same time.That being said, for basic computing needs (word processing, watching Netflix, web browsing, blogging, writing a novel, taking classes, etc...), this laptop is near perfect and budget-friendly.Couple Notes: - The processor is 1.1 ghz, not 2.8 as listed in description, but really, you wouldn't be doing anything on this that should ever require that much processor speed. - Memory is upgradeable, which is nice, but I've found that 4gb is fine for what I'm using it for right now. - Laptop looks stylish, but lacks that ""high-end"" feel - but it's a $200 laptop.  Still, I like it and keyboard feels good for typing at length. - Screen is sharp.  Colors are decent.  Not the best screen out there, of course, but certainly not bad at all.  Not a touch screen...slight bummer but not a big deal to me. - Sound coming from speakers is nice and loud.  No, not premium sound, but sufficient to watch movies/video classes and hear it just fine.  I'm happy with it, but no audiophile.  Use headphones or a Bluetooth speaker if you want better sound. - Performance has been fast and I've been satisfied. - Easy to switch from Windows S to full Windows Home, which is my preference and why I opted for this over a Chromebook. - 81gb of available storage space after OS and apps take up a bit of the 128 gb drive.  To me, that's totally fine since I'm not saving anything on this - it all goes in the cloud. - I don't think the battery will actually last 9 hours with normal settings, but I get a solid 5 or so hours out of it between charges.RE: Slowness/Lagginess:A couple negative reviews mentioned this and when it happened to me, I thought that maybe there WAS something off about this computer.Turns out when I logged into my Microsoft account, it started syncing my existing desktop computer with this laptop, and with only 4gb of memory and slower processor, it just bogged it right down for about 20 minutes or so as it synced apps, desktop icons, etc....  Once everything synced up, it was fine and has been ever since.So if you experience slow, laggy performance when you first get this, and you've logged into your Microsoft account, set it down and let it sync for 20 minutes or so, or better yet, adjust the sync settings to be more selective.All in all, it's a great, inexpensive laptop that is super lightweight, super portable, looks nice, performs great, and is perfect for basic computing, an older child/teen, college courses, etc...",5.0 out of 5 stars,DavyandTracy,174 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1

B0BL35XNF5,Acer-A115-32-C96U-Processor-Microsoft-Subscription,Amazingly Good Deal,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2024","I have tablets and a Big Screen desl Windows Computer and two small computers.  One small computer is tied into my piano for online piano lesson. The other a nice but small chrome computer than I never use. I dislike chrome.I missed my 15 inch computer that bit the dust years ago and I suddenly decided to get the cheapest brand name computer.  At 200 dollars and a bit of change I found the Acer computer.  Being a computer nerd I saw that it had what I needed and should be fast enough.It is hard reading reviews today half will say it is perfect and the other half will say it is junk.I am bet this Acer computer by looking at the specs it will be perfect for my needs. Its a well known brand large computer at a very small price.Getting started was a easy, the diplay was bright and nice to read and the setup was easy and fast.It ask a bunch of questions and I said no to most of them. The sound is terrible but with a bluetooth speakers or headphones it is perfect.If you are reviewing this computer giving a review as if you were receiveing a 500 dollar computer really dose not help anyone.  This is a great computer for its price range and it seems to have what I need.Keeping Windows in the S mode is a no brainer for this laptop.  You will have to suffer minor convenices of using a Microsoft Browsers and using only the software from the Microsoft Store.  Not a big deal.  If you need to run other software, break down and buy a bigger computer.However with the types of bad stuff out there this is a safer method and you do not the bloated stuff that takes away huge amounts of memory with installing Windows.  Remember you can not go back to mode s easily if you change your mind.The bottom line this is a deal at 200 dollars",5.0 out of 5 stars,David,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1

B0BL35XNF5,Acer-A115-32-C96U-Processor-Microsoft-Subscription,Two things I don't like about this laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2024","My laptop crashed and in a panic I bought this one. It's fine for a backup, you can't beat the price for a backup. But when my original fixed laptop comes back, I'll be reverting to it. I'll keep this as a backup. What I don't like - it's very slow. I only use it for internet research and writing papers for my MA program. All my files are in the cloud. It takes several seconds for it to respond to a command, such as opening a new application or a new document or a new tab. And it's not my internet. I do stream Netflix and it's fine. Occasionally I see a little lag or an indication it's not quite keeping up, but it works. It's when I perform an action that it takes so long to respond. And the second thing is - I can't wake it up!!! If I close the laptop at night, in the morning it takes at least two minutes to wake it up. I press enter, mouse click, Ctrl, nothing works. I start to panic thinking it's crashed, but then finally it starts telling me I have to put in my PIN. So to avoid this issue, if I'm going to leave it for more than an hour, I close everything and completely power down. I've posted the question about whether I can add more memory but I've only gotten unhelpful sarcastic answers (people need to get a life), and the information I've found online and in and other reviews here is conflicting.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Diane,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1
B0BL35XNF5,Acer-A115-32-C96U-Processor-Microsoft-Subscription,Great computer for my purpose!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023","I love this computer!  Here's why...  I wanted a portable computer that I could use for getting information from the web and for typing documents.  I saw this computer and figured that for the price I couldn't go wrong.  I was more right than I imagined.First thing was to get rid of that Windowa S.  Installed Linux Mint 21.2 and my favorite (and ONLY) office suite Softmaker Office 2024.  For typing/editing documents this system is incredible.  It is as light as a Chromebook, runs forever (8+ hours) on a full charge, has a very sharp display (I have bad vision so this was important), decent sound (great with bluetooth headset :)) and a good enough keyboard that I can type at a reasonable speed.  With Microsoft Edge (yeah, I love the Edge browser) and the Brave browser I have no problem finding the information I need.  All-in-all this computer is ideal for what I needed to do.  I have already shown it to a couple of people with the same needs as me.  One of the best purchases I have made in a long time!!!One thing that I did do was get a tiny 64 GB USB drive and make it my primary working storage.  That way I wear out a throwaway device instead of my eMMC which probably isn't replaceable.Finally, small reality check.  This IS NOT a computer for playing games.  Not even simple ones.  Hearts or solitaire or Minesweeper should be okay, but graphics games are just going to be a non-starter.  I got mine for research and writing and for that it is perfect.  But, its just not a gaming machine.And, considering how inexpensive it is, for me it just doesn't get any better.BTW, I own several other computers (mostly Acer) with Linux, Windows and ChromeOS.  I am writing this review ON the computer I am reviewing.  This is the computer I use most of the time, and the one that goes with me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wayne Donner,38 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1
B0BL35XNF5,Acer-A115-32-C96U-Processor-Microsoft-Subscription,If you want to get out of S mode….,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2024","The laptop itself is great. It’s lightweight, decent battery, fast enough for daily normal useBUT…It comes with Windows 11 in S mode. Microsoft made the questionable decision to restrict what apps you may download to only ones supported in their App Store (ex. Google chrome is blocked so they all but force you to use THEIR browser). There is a way to bypass this but it is ridiculously hard. I spent two days following Microsoft’s instructions (which never worked) as well as any hints I could find online. What finally worked was doing a reset of the computer. After the reset I went directly to the settings and I was FINALLY able to disable S mode. If that hadn’t worked I was going to do a factory reset and send this laptop back. This will be the last Windows computer I will purchase. When I buy a computer I SHOULD be able to easily download any apps I want. If I had known the Windows in S mode is so hard to disable I would have never purchased this laptop.Again the laptop itself is fine. You will need a lot of patience to get to the point where you can set it up the way YOU want it versus what Microsoft pushes on you.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1

It is low cost solution for me and will get beat up with enough travel. This was my solution to obtain a low cost lap top for this kind of travel.One issue is the lack of keyboard lighting. A little deal I know. In low light (which this will be used in) it is difficult to see the keys. Another issue is 10 key on the far right serves other functions like the HOME and END keys. The operator has to shift to operate those keys to get the HOME, END and a couple of other functions.The transaction was very good. Well packed and well shipped.

But it's not up to me—a job I took requires a particular version of VMWare Horizon Client and doesn't support web VMWare, so I held my nose and placed the order.Long story short, through no fault of Acer's, this machine in 2024 requires a factory reset after its initial setup just to turn off S Mode so you can install 3rd party software. Once you've jumped through Redmond's hoops (Bring us a shrubbery! Ni!), This little machine functions reasonably well under the weight of too many stupid useless pre-installed apps and all the stock MS nagware, un-refusable Xbox Live offers, and info-widgets nobody wants or needs.If you absolutely must have a Windows laptop (to keep a job) and you have the patience to spend 7 hours setting it up, then this machine might do.But for God's sake, if you don't absolutely have to use some platform-limited software, do yourself a huge favor and get a high-spec Chromebook.

And you cannot make it stop. Nor can you change the default browser from what magnificent Microsoft has provided for you. Also, you cannot use any apps that are not approved by Microsoft. The hard sell to get you to buy into Office 365 is all they seem to care about, not that your computer experience is something that suits your needs.

I bought this laptop with the intent to use it for work. I need to be able to access 9 websites, check my email, and run numbers. Pretty simple stuff that I’m after. It arrived today. Unoboxing was painfully simple. The user manual is all but useless, in my humble opinion. There were multiple updates to be had.. which is to be expected as I can only assume the computer is actually a couple of years old despite this being its first use outside of the quality control diagnostics. Y’all. I was on Amazon chat for an hour and a half, 6 different agents, and no assistance in my issue. This is advertised as included with Windows 11 Pro. I had to call Microsoft and be walked through how to locate the key associated with the device only to discover my product key had already be used on a DIFFERENT DEVICE and was no longer available for my use, despite my paying for it. My new laptop wanted me to pay for a $200+ licensed product key despite it being sold to me with 11 Pro included. I got lucky and the rep with Microsoft support was able to get my Windows activated.Please read and learn from my misfortune.Aside from that huge hiccup upon receiving and set up, I’m now logged into all of my accounts and am very excited to have a computer that I’ve never written a high school essay on. Note there is no Ethernet access, no CD/DVD ROM, nor does it have a full sized HDMI port. These aren’t deal breakers for me simply because this computer was bought for work purposes opposed to personal.I’m very impressed by how light it is, the backlit keyboard, the fingerprint sensor, number pad, and the screen quality.

Complete lie unfortunately.Outside of that, I am not keeping it a zero star because for the bang for the buck you are still getting a rather workable laptop that can do minimal office stuff without too much issue. I have an external monitor I have used with it and it does the job I need for a cheap price temporarily until I obtain a proper replacement laptop.If you are in a bind and need a laptop that just works for office or school related items this is a really good choice for the price.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Miles Dunn,,Verified Purchase,2,1

B0CGRTXH96,FUNYET-Computer-Processor-Fingerprint-Keyboard,Nice Computer but with reservations,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024","I bought this FunYet 16"" pro computer to replace my old Dell 15"" ..... The computer coms packed quite well and is very sturdy material. It arrives within four days from Kirkland, Washington. The screen is very bright and has good definition and contrast. The keyboard is the standard, and the keys are clean and responsive. Here are the negatives: (1) The battery does NOT last as advertised; the battery barely lasts 3 hours, and when turned off at night, loses 50% of its power when opened up the next morning. (2) there are no HDMI ports (3) There is no SD card slot (4) The power port is too close to a USB port and hard to use due to its proximity. One will need to purchase additional devices to accommodate these slots, or even an extender to support multiple attachments. ..... I emailed customer support as to the battery issue, and their answer was, ""My computer does the same thing"". Since this unit is only 10 days from purchase, I will update in a month or two ... PS. I purchased an extended 4-year warranty to cover my Funyet, as they have NO representation in the USA. UPDATE:  I have now had a lot more time on this Funjet computer, and the cooperation from Customer Service is quite lacking. The battery will not stay full at all and drains down to 64% overnight with the unit turned off. The computer skips when you are trying to load an address or even insert a URL address. I am very concerned about service if this Funyet computer need work. We need to have customer support in the USA; not in China. I will be returning this unit to AMazon for a full refund.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Richard,13 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,3,1

B0CGRTXH96,FUNYET-Computer-Processor-Fingerprint-Keyboard,"Pretty good, but not for gaming","Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","Yo, I'm an fps player (usually overwatch, cod, apex, etc.) and I gotta say, this laptop is not the one if your on a budget. I can't even play the  game I'm playing without the laptop immediately stuttering. And then the specs say that it can run 60 frames.. Nope, fortnite can't even stay at 6 frames (and don't even ask about warzone, apex, overwatch, destiny, mainly because they can't run 2 frames even with low settings). However I can't really beat up this laptop too much, it does has its perks. It can handle editing high projects, at the cost of how long the extract is (I use After Effects). The screen quality is pretty smooth, making a cozy binge-watch for youtube or just watching streams. I hadn't tested if you can stream/video call yet so that will be in a later update.Overall this laptop is definitely NOT a gaming laptop, however it can run small games like The Sims 4, roblox, etc.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Lolra Huya,6 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,4,1

Zippy, set up was a breeze, and it seemed to be a pretty confident-feeling $299 purchase. The intent was for my kiddo to run Roblox, so the first thing I did was download the app. Didn't work. Huh. Little research, turns out its relatively common to see Roblox and Win 11 not playing nice. Tried a second method by downloading directly from the website. Still no luck.I check Windows Update to make sure everything is up to date. Curiously there was one update that wouldn't apply, no matter what I did. Upon several restarts, still nothing. Update was stuck. Was recommended to reset PC to factory settings. Did that. And on reinstall, the laptop wouldn't connect to wifi, so Windows couldn't reinstall fully. Ended up being stick in a restart loop with no way to fix. Sent back to Amazon for full refund.Suffice to say my experience was not good, but I have no way of knowing if there was something wrong with the harddrive, or software, or what. It remains a mystery to me. Sad, because it seemed like a promising purchase. Part of me expected to have issues, but I'm frustrated I was right. But again, it could be Win11.

B0CTFMTHD8,Inspiron-Business-Touchscreen-i5-1155G7-Microsoft,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER !!!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2024","I can only begin this review with serious misgivings about this particular Dell Inspirion laptop.  When one purchases a product from a ""Dell Vendor"", one presumes it is a 100% Dell product.  Apparently this was not the case with this laptop.  Exactly 3 days after the Amazon/Vendor's return policy ran out, this laptop stopped working.  The error message was ""Corrupt Hard Drive"".  I can understand electronic devices will sometimes have issues.  I can also understand manufacturers and vendors need to have a limit on how long they will allow items to be returned.  So we called Dell Warranty Service, and they were very helpful.  They sent a box, pre-paid shipping label and we thought that would be the end of it.  Wait a reasonable time for the laptop to be repaired under warranty, and we could go on with our lives.  NOT SO.  According to the Dell Warranty Center, this particular laptop has a 3rd Party Hard Drive.  Not a hard-drive provided by Dell or installed by Dell or used by Dell.  So... our laptop was... in fact... not able to be repaired under warranty.  Dell has offered to fix the laptop and install the correct, but the repair is nearly as much as the laptop cost new from Amazon.  This is totally unacceptable!  When we bought the laptop, we presumed it was a new Dell Laptop with appropriately sourced and installed electronics that would be approved by Dell (or installed by Dell)... BUYER BEWARE of ROKC Electronics.  They have offered NO Help,  NO Sympathy,  and we are now completely out of the money we spent, and have a laptop that is absolutely Useless!!!!  I can only imagine if we were still in the window for return, they would put the same Non-Dell parts back in, and we would be facing similar issues down the road.  This is not the way to run a business.  And certainly not the way an Amazon vendor should be doing business.  Very Very Very Disappointed!",1.0 out of 5 stars,Capt.

B0BZXZSG4J,Lenovo-IdeaPad-Pentium-Microsoft-Windows,I Should have Bought Two!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2024",Purchased this unit for my church to update our computers. I should have purchased two of these as the price was around $188. The prices has gone up to $280 roughly now. I use the computer for church bookkeeping and money management including an occasional Excel spreadsheet. I have had zero issues with speed and calculating spreadsheets. No delays. No spinning buffering. The screen is beautiful and crisp for bookkeeping purposes. The computer comes standard with a numeric keypad built in. Very handy for accounting of course. My personal Lenovo Carbon doesn't have this and you'll miss the numeric keypad if you have worked with them in the past. Seems like plenty of memory and storage for my needs. Computer boots very quickly due to the SSD and other solid state memory. I'm hoping the price will come back down. $188 was a super bargain.

So far, it looks to work just fine for that.One big surprise: I bought this thinking it was new.  Nowhere does it say refurbished.  But, the warranty info is elusive and it's a third party seller.  When I got the PC setup and checked the Lenovo Advantage website, it said I was out of warranty and could extend it for a price.  So, is it used?  Grey market? Who knows.

B0BZXZSG4J,Lenovo-IdeaPad-Pentium-Microsoft-Windows,Good Value,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2023","Initial Review June 1, 2023You usually get what you pay for. For the price this is a pretty decent laptop.We have five computers in our house. One of them failed so we needed to replace it. But with so much computing power already in the family we didn't need to spend a lot on a new laptop that will be used only for school projects. No gaming or heavy graphics. This seemed to be a reasonably equipped Lenovo branded laptop for about $350. We didn't expect blazing performance, and don't need it. Given these conditions this turned out to be a pretty decent laptop.The only time I've felt the computer was slow was when opening an app. Instead of the blistering speed of my desktop this laptop takes about 3-5X longer to open an app. Pulling up an app on my desktop might take 2 seconds while this laptop takes more like 8 seconds. Once the app or web page is open I don't notice anything that seems to be slow. Most school tasks involve typing, drag and drop, perhaps photo editing. If you need to edit video you may want to buy a more powerful laptop. Not only is this a bit slow for editing but it doesn't have a powerful GPU.They didn't spend much design time on keeping the laptop light weight. It's a bit on the heavy side but manageable.- 12GB of RAM is quite generous.- Sound through the built in speakers is surprisingly good.- 256GB of storage is enough for school work, more can be added using the SD card slot. Unfortunately the SD card slot isn't deep so 1/2 of the SD card sticks out.- The screen is not a touchscreen.- The screen is clear and sharp with good colors.- The screen is bright but may not work well outdoors with bright sunlight.- The keyboard is okay to type on but they decided to cram a number keypad beside the keyboard so the key spacing is a little tight. Many people appreciate having a number keypad but I never use one.- Having volume up/down and a brightness up/down keys are very handy.- The keyboard is not backlit.- Battery life is acceptble. A full charge lasted me about 4 hours while I used it to set up windows and other apps. I was on the computer continuously for all of those 4 hours.- The SD card reader is a bonus. I would not have expected that feature from a low cost computer.- It has a USB-C port which is great, but that port won't charge the laptop battery. That would have been a bonus feature but I think they left it out to keep the cost low. Charging has to be done through the AC power port.- I did use a bluetooth headset with the computer which worked fine.I recommend this laptop",5.0 out of 5 stars,J.

My only complaint is that it came loaded with Windows 11 S.  What this does is make it so you can't load any apps on the computer that aren't in Microsoft's Store.  Just another power grab on the part of Microsoft.  You are supposed to be able to go to System-->Activation and go to the Microsoft store to get out of 'S' mode, but it didn't work for me.

B0CZKS6XHB,HP-Stream-BrightView-N4120-Graphics,Keys Popped Off After a Few Uses,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2021","This laptop isn't ideal for a lot of reasons, but it does what it's meant to do -- very simple things. So, when the display colors were really off and it was a bit slow at certain programs, I didn't mind too much.However, the very first time I used this laptop, the F key popped off. I pressed it back in, haven't had any further issues with that key, and thought okay -- that was weird and kind of annoying for just having received the laptop, but that's fine. It seems to be fixed.Unfortunately, just after the return period ended, the C key popped off. This was after maybe a week or two of use. (I had saved the laptop for a specific trip, so after the initial setup with the F key incident, I didn't use it for a while until I got to my trip destination.)The C key now pops off routinely, and I constantly have to stop typing and press it back in. I can see there are a couple of other keys that seem to be threatening to do the same.Given that a good portion of my work is as a freelance writer, this is an incredibly frustrating problem to have. Although, I imagine it would be frustrating regardless. I don't think a computer I've only used consistently for a few weeks should have this many problems.While it's lightweight, has a great battery life, and more or less functions the way I need it to for basic online and MS Office tasks, the constant key issues force me to downgrade the star rating.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Courtney Herz,5 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,2,1

It operated very very slowly when first powered up but runs well now, I believe it was just all the updates that needed installing that slowed it up. My big complaint is that the camera/webcam does not work, all it shows is a black screen, this is a problem as I bought this for my wife to video chat with her parents and its kind of pointless without the camera, I spent a while looking up potential fixes and troubleshooting but have found no success, and from all my digging I found that it's a pretty common problem with this computer, I wish I would have known before buying. The camera is still non-functional but otherwise the computer works well.

B09CP1QSR6,Dell-Convertible-Touchscreen-Chromebook-Processor,Refurbed?! Excellent Condition!! Scam!!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023","This was a complete FAILURE on Global Certified Authentic's part.When the product arrived at my door I was highly excited to open it and package it as a gift to my son who is an over the road driver.When I opened the product and inspected the unit I was disappointed to find the following:The casing had a deep scratch on the bottom of the unit. Multiple others all over the device.The charging port was completely useless. It looked as if there was a broken charger snapped off inside the port. The unit would not even turn on.Upon receiving the replacement unit and charging cable, the power supply did not have the proper wattage to charge the device.Again, disappointing 😞 .I contacted the company yet again concerning this issue. I was advised that they no longer had any chargers for the unit in stock and that a refund of only $15 would be provided. Would you please locate me an OEM Dell charger for this device for $15.Well, let me tell you something. The charger that was shipped with the only working unit on the first order which is what was needed for the second cost much more than the amount that was offered as a refund.The product description said excellent condition. These devices are to go through a rigorous refurbishment process to check them for faults to see what has to be replaced or repaired.

B09CP1QSR6,Dell-Convertible-Touchscreen-Chromebook-Processor,great starter Chromebook,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021","Arrived fully charged (which I didn't expect), packed in a tightly fitting air-filled pouch. It had the included thumb drive, a charger and instructions from the vendor on how to return if necessary, and how to leave product reviews. There were no instructions, or a manual, which was no surprise, this being a refurb. I purchased this as an inexpensive upgrade for an old Android tablet that was too small for my needs; not enough room to keep the stuff I want. The tablet took about an hour to get all the stuff I wanted loaded on it, and it seems to be working great so far. Setup was simple, and being fully charged on arrival helped with lessening the feeling of time crunch. You know: the feeling the app won't load before you run out of battery. There was none of that. My earbuds paired and connected with no drama, and it's great having an integral keyboard instead of a Bluetooth one.  Both touchscreen and touchpad cursor control are available, for whatever floats your boat. I personally suffer from fat finger syndrome, and use a mouse a lot, and that works too.  I don't know why this was refurbished, as I have not found a reason to think it hasn't always been in good shape. It's working great for me so far, and the only malfunctions have been my own fault, mostly the above fat-finger comment. It's worth the money, and if you don't HAVE to have the ""latest and greatest"" this will work just fine.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mike Bell,35 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1

Bought this as a decent backup computer to travel with a nd run my business. On arrival I charged the device fully and powered it on. I noticed food residue on the device and wiped it down fully with Clorox wipes. The fun didn't stop there, the case was damaged and had loose screws in the back of the device. No biggie I can tighten those up and get to work. I logged into the wifi in my vehicle and tried to connect. This was a child's tablet from some school. Once past the main wifi and update screens it asked for a password to a school I've never heard about. I tried to reset/power wash the system No go. I called support, they wanted to initiate a return instantly. I said let's try to fix it. Still no go so now I have a 70 Dollar brick and I still can't send emails on the go like I wanted to. As a claims adjuster this would be nice to have on the go, so I don't have to bring my 17 inch out on the road for any kind of potential damage. But someone dropped the ball on this one. Not only was it not reset I don't even think it went through an inspection for it to be in the excellent section of this website. Sorry but this is a fail in terms of use.

It is actually a Dell 11.6"" Chromebook 11 3189 from 2018, and I have no idea why thy lied about it, I still would have bought it. I just wanted a cheap Chromebook to watch videos on, with and HDMI port, and that's what I got, but the deceit just really rubs me the wrong way. The condition of mine is pretty good but certainly not excellent. There is a small imperfection in the display, and the battery shows as 78% health. Both of which I would have expected to be fixed on a truly refurbished product.  Additionally the laptop is no longer supported and will not receive updates from google any more, which is also pretty suspect considering its supposed to be 2021 model. Overall I got what I wanted, but I would recommend buying something different given the dishonesty of the description in terms of quality and the actual product.Update: The battery completely died within 3 weeks of purchase. I requested a replacement and they send me another one with 78% battery health out of the box, and it is a 2017!!!

B09CP1QSR6,Dell-Convertible-Touchscreen-Chromebook-Processor,Very slow but some good things to go with it,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2023","I'll start with the positive. It's just enough to have a decent zoom call with. The touchscreen is more responsive than I thought it would be. The 2 in 1 function as a tablet is great for portability to take to work with you which is the reason I bought it. Low onboard memory but the expandable SD slot can boost that to be like a regular laptop. The HDMI port makes it ideal for presentations as long as you're not using any internet. It surprisingly plays streaming videos just fine. The headphone jack even lets me plug in external speakers.  And lastly the battery life is extremely good. I left it ""on"" (the screen will power down but the computer will still be on to be awake at the touch of the mouspad or key) and after 4 days of not realizing it, it still had a fourth of the battery left.To the bad: Every single webpage or google app that you go to or try to open will take an extremely long time, even right out of the box. 15-20 seconds to open a simple website being under wifi with a fiber connected modem that can flawlessly stream 4K across 4 TVs at once without a buffer (it means I have very fast internet).

I have 90 days to return this so I am at least going to see if it functions properly and will update my review if I change my mind about it.

The touch screen is flawless, and the computer arrived with all necessary parts. HOWEVER, the title of the product I ordered said this would be a 2021 model, and very clearly the manufacture year of the model sent to me was 2017.That makes a big difference in terms of how long a Chromebook can receive updates, as this one will no longer receive updates and the only way to get them would be to purchase a newer model. That was exactly why I was interested in the 2021 model and NOT something older.If you are buying anything renewed, just make sure you receive what you thought you were ordering!

Maybe it takes a $300 laptop so I don't have to deal with built in Alexa-enabled something, HP-specific ports, fingerprint scanner, and other stuff I don't want or need. They don't try anything fancy with this one which for me is a positive. Plus it's TKL keyboard which really should be the new norm. Does not have a backlit keyboard which is a slight miss but for the price it's not a huge deal.You can take it out of S-mode easily and remove a lot of the addons and you have yourself a perfectly functional Windows machine. Despite the lower-tier hardware it still starts up very quickly if you make sure you don't have too much bloatware. Sure it's a little slow at times but if you're using it for day to day tasks it should be fine. Battery life seems very good, the laptop is also fairly lightweight as well.

If you're lured to these by an Amazon flash offer, and begin to compare other options/offers, be sure to throughly compare the descriptions. Or you'll purchase something you didn't want. If you find this out after you set everything up and there is no problem with the computer itself, you're stuck with it. The other issue I had was the inability to exit Win 11 S mode. After hours of trying the standard method and several youtube videos with complex work arounds, I gave up. Today I decided to express my feelings in the MS Edge search window and I received this response from Copilot. (posted in the picture above). I post because subsequent requests produced different results. This work around worked quickly and was a three step fix. Have exited S mode and am happily running Google Chrome. Plus all my Google info and files from my broken laptop ported over. One last note: this is definitely a computer for students. It is priced reasonably considering post Covid greedflation prices. It is comparetively slow and not for use use for gamers. I will keep it as I need a computer for research and writing papers.5/30/2024-My laptop broke. Needed to complete paperwork for a project with tight time lured by ""Deal"" for laptop with 4GB ram 64 storage Bluetooth, Wi-Fi. $169, 12hr delivery.  I figure it was good enough to get my work done. At the site several other options were available with the same features and more memory. All had delivery dates of 1=2 days except 1 with 8GB ram, 192GB storage for $259 w/ $40 coupon, Thought extra memory and storage was worth extra $90. Computer arrived. It took an 1-1/2 hr to do updates. When I tried to download Chrome to work in Google docs {state recommended for changes}. This computer is locked into MS S mode blocking download of apps not in MS store. After spending 2hrs trying  different S mode exit directions is was resolved to doing the work on my Samsung S20 which took 3 hours to do 1 hr of work. This computer doesn't have Bluetooth, is extremely slow. MS locks y into using Edge in a worse case scenario than they did with Explorer 25 yrs ago. Don't be lured by the free1yr of Home 365. Cannot return because I used it and is technically not broken. HP is obviously returning to the days of cheap low-grade Compaq. Clearest example of Greedflation.

I bought the HP 14"" Stream Ultralight Laptop thinking, it was a good addition to my current desktop HP computer running Windows 11. Setting up the new PC was easy, perhaps too easy. New PC asked for router password which I gave.  PC asked for permission to copy all my files from my old desktop.  I am figuring “what the heck” it made set up new PC easy. Big mistake!  You have to understand everything was automatic up this point.  I didn’t get real feel for the laptop. When I finally got around to actually using PC it was BAD.  It picked sometimes without hitting left button (the “hover” function was turned on --- I tried to turn off NOPE).  Often, I had to press the left button several times to pick.  Later on, when I hit left button it acted as if I pressed right button. (given a choice number of actions “open new window” etc.). I requested a return and Amazon approved my request.  But here’s the rub: Amazon does not want my personal files on the laptop.  But my new laptop is a clone of old desktop through the connection with THE CLOUD – anything I do to one of PC is reflected on other PC!  I thought I broke the connection by disabling the laptop access to router NOPE.  When I try to delete a file from laptop, the laptop says “cannot delete file because you are offline”.  Apparently, the new laptop is a good PC, I just happened get this lemon.  I will try to show you the problems on video. I could only upload one video -- I press the left button and PC act like I pressed the right button.",3.0 out of 5 stars,John D Sanregret,12 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1

I don't really use the mouse tracking pad, but it hooks up to my USB mouse just fine! I think that this laptop would be perfect for someone who doesn't need to load a lot of programs, maybe someone who enjoys streaming videos, or just browsing the internet. Overall I think this is a good laptop for the price, but do your research to make sure this is what you are looking for.

Windows 11 takes up most of the internal storage leaving you with 56Gbs on the eMMC. Not sure how well this will handle down the road with security updates and so on.  Also note, if you try to install anything not verified by Microsoft (which is everything) you'll be assisted into circle of frustration.  After much research, you need to go to the Microsoft App store and search for ""Switching out of S mode"", insanity...  I removed some of the bloatware installed and found some malware that Malwarebytes picked up before doing anything.

Design. The keyboard is set unnecessarily high. There doesn’t need to be that much space at the bottom of the keyboard. It’s not ergonomically functional. I am a writer and I frequently lose paragraphs at a time because as I’m typing my palm slides over the touch pad and highlights text. I often find myself wondering what happened to a whole block of text. Obviously clicking the undo button in the middle of a writing project could mean clicking undo 75 times before you find the mistake.2. The screen is way too small for a writer because it is long. That means that your document will only display about 4 inches at a time unless you minimize the text down to about 70%. As a writer, these options are very frustrating.3. I believe this laptop was advertised as a touchscreen, it is not.4. Auto sync- don’t do it unless you really want everything transferred over to your brand new laptop. I have old files that should’ve been deleted from my old computer now on my new computer and I never wanted any of that. Be really careful with the options you select if you do end up buying this laptop.What I do like about the computer is that it’s",2.0 out of 5 stars,Sara,3 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,7,1

B0CKN6R3X7,Dell-Chromebook-Computer-Celeron-Bluetooth,"Not a bad Chromebook, but not what was advertised.","Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024","I ordered this Chromebook for a bit of research on ChromeOS.  I was specifically interested in the Dell 3180 since I'm familiar with many Dell laptop products.Upon receipt of the Chromebook, it was not the Dell 3180 I expected, but an HP Chromebook II G6 EE (see photos).  For what it is, it is equivalent to the Dell Chromebook (size and profile, micro-SD card slot), but uses the USB-C port for power and recharging.  The 3180 (from the photo) uses a barrel jack for power, which I find more rubust and reliable than the USB-C port.I am giving the HP Chromebook a chance for the research.  I only wished the details of the actual make/model had been accurate; this oversight I might expect from eBay, but never not from Amazon, regardless if the product was directly from Amazon or from its partners.I might decide to purchase a second unit for my research; but only if I could be assured that I would  receive the actual make and model of Dell Chromebook advertised.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Clay Erickson,,Verified Purchase,2,1

Suddenly, the system did not even recognize that the display is a touch screen. Rolling back Win 11 update, having device manager human interface search for hardware changes, doing Dell-recommended hard reset did nothing. Dell support arranged shipping to them. Dell was good about handling this promptly. Dell replaced the FACTORY 256GB SSD and removed the NOT-FACTORY Kingston 1TB SSD (yes, there are two SSD slots). It shipped the 1TB back with the unit in a separate bag. I replied to Dell support email that I received it back and had questions. Dell rep called me and patiently answered my questions. Though his accent was strongly far-eastern, I could understand most of what he said and he kindly repeated when asked.In short, 3rd party retailers will supe up a Dell product (in this case) to upgrade its specifications. I've used Kingston drives many times with no issues, so this is not a criticism of Kingston per se.  But for whatever reason it was either faulty or incompatible.This purchase was a good deal even if it turns out to be 256 GB rather than 1TB. The problem is it wasted a ton of my time to resolve.See images for Dell return letter and Dell rep reply to my questions after we spoke on the phone.My only annoyance with Dell is that when they reinstalled Windows 11 home on the new SSD, they installed the S version. Windows claims the S stands for more ""secure."" Perhaps, but you can ONLY install 3rd party apps downloaded from the Microsoft store. So, I could not install Zoom! That's unacceptable. I googled how to remove the S ""feature"" permanently. That worked, and I could then install the Zoom app.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Karen,4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1

Since I cannot be without a laptop for the 10 days (at least) it would take to fix the small hinge problem, this is not feasible.

I ordered it on October 15. My son used it in November to apply for admission in January. This week while on a zoom call with the college, the computer screen went blank, except for a white horizontal line. If you check, you will find few options to get through to Dell for either service or to give a review. Since I bought it from Amazon, I called their customer service number. My only option is to return it to Amazon and they will credit my account with over $135 less than I paid for it. It is their policy not to give full refunds after 30 days from purchase date. The customer service representative was thorough, professional and sympathetic, stressed that he had no choice but to refund my account for a fraction of our cost when we send back the useless Dell computer. I’ve used Amazon for a long time as many people, particularly senior citizens, use for their shopping during the holidays, especially. Please be careful, especially when ordering an expensive item from Dell or through Amazon.

First of all, the process of import into China was not fully disclosed by Amazon at the time of transaction. Consumer needs to share a lot of documentation. The device does not come with basic apps preinstalled. Meaning, although the OS is Win 11, the device does not have MS Office pack bundled with the OS. But these apps are ""pinned"" to the screen. When you open, say, Word or PPT document, the user is prompted to buy MS-Office monthly or annual subscription. You feel as if MS OS has made both hardware/device (Dell) and the user inconsequential and incidental -- such is the overwhelming, overpowering nature of MS presence on the PC. So unlike in the past. You don't feel empowered but dwarfed, conned, manipulated and tricked. Had I been proactively informed by Amazon and Dell that the device does not come with any frequently used basic software/apps, i would not probably have bought this PC.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Siva Sankar,3 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,6,1

B0CT3WX363,Lenovo-Quad-core-Processor-Ethernet-Bluetooth,"Should not be this slow, given the specs","Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024","I'm not totally convinced I received a computer with the specs outlined in the description. I kinda think they swapped some parts on this computer, because there is not reason for a computer with these specs to perform this terribly right out of the box. Also, Windows 11 is terrible.A few issues I’m having:-The computer keeps shutting down instead of going to sleep. When I step away for lunch, I come back and the computer won’t wake up. I click, press buttons on the keyboard, and even press the power button, but nothing happens. I have to hold down the power button and the computer reboots. This causes me to lose everything I’m working on and I need to reopen everything.-The USB-C jack does not work with the HDMI. I have an adapter to connect the keyboard, mouse, and monitor via the USB-C. This worked on my old Lenovo computer, but does not work on this one. I would prefer to unplug one thing instead of 4 different things if I want to move around with my laptop.-The USB-C jack is emitting power, even when shut down. This leads to batter drain. This never happened with my old computer.-The headphone jack does not work.-The computer is very slow and laggy. If I try to browse the internet during a zoom meeting the meeting gets very laggy.

B0CT3WX363,Lenovo-Quad-core-Processor-Ethernet-Bluetooth,Shameful Warranty,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024","Where to start. That's easy, don't ever buy a Lenovo laptop. I purchased mine in March of 2024 and the screen stopped working within 6-weeks of the first use. I then contacted Lenovo as it was obviously still under warranty and was instructed to ship to their service center for repair. Once it arrived at Lenovo and was diagnosed, I then received an email back with a quote of $164.68 to have it repaired. The symptom they gave was as follows: CID - 3rd Party SSD. When I emailed back asking for clarification on ""3rd Party SSD and why that wasn't covered, was then told that the Lenovo warranty doesn’t cover 3rd party parts. Keep in mind that this was a laptop purchased through Amazon new and arrived in original Lenovo packaging. They basically passed the buck on the repair and wouldn't agree to honor the warranty. There's no way that this machine had any part other than the originals as manufactured by Lenovo. Once explaining the situation to Amazon, they were quick to give me a full refund once the original unit was returned. Sadly I've been without a laptop for over a month now, and all of this has been a huge headache. The laptop was hardly used and never left my office desk. This is nothing more than a cop out by Lenovo to honor its warranty and would not recommend that anyone buy this laptop or any other from Lenovo. They obviously don't mind selling their products through 3rd party vendors (yes Amazon), but will not honor the warranty. I would love to share my email exchange with you all, but there is a disclaimer that basically says that the information in the email is confidential and that any copying or distribution of its contents is unlawful.

But then was immediately greeted with this error message asking if I wanted to reboot from a device, troubleshoot, or turn the computer off.I never got a chance to turn my new laptop on and set it up because Lenovo sent me a Used, Already Turned On, Already Error Messaged laptop AS NEW.Lenovo had previously been my go-to and I trusted them. That trust is gone.

B097WD9P4K,Samsung-Electronics-Galaxy-Chromebook-i3-Processor,Exactly what I needed!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2024","I have had some very nice laptops that cost thousands of dollars.  I also own a high-end Lenovo but this is my go-to.  The Fiesta Red color is stunning.  Boots up quickly, nice feel to the keys, track pad is responsive and the the screen is crystal clear yielding sharp, vibrant images.  I don't need as much out of a laptop like I used to (I am retired), but I teach English in South America and do lots of very complex PowerPoints.  You can run multiple screens simultaneously with videos, easy to splice, computer does not ""hang"" at all.  We Chromebook lovers know how great Google OS is...excellent security, updates only require a re-boot, on-line and hard drive storage, excellent stability.  Chromebooks have come a long way and are biting into the regular laptop market and this one may surprise you. The metal casing is protective and sturdy.  Screen is versatile and opens fully to tablet form.  Touchscreen is excellent...what else can I say.  I will update if I run into any problems but at this point I have no issues.  Before breaking the bank on a ""regular"" laptop (and then you are stuck with Microsoft Windows and the crazy updates that don't recognize your peripherals, screw up your drivers and generally suck), check out a good Chromebook.  You will save lots of money and get a better machine with a better operating system that looks nice and performs.",5.0 out of 5 stars,BDK,12 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,1

I took a chance because of the price.  I am enjoying using it for now.  I had purchased a cheaper chromebook which was driving me crazy because it was so slow and clunky.  I couldn't maneuver on some website with heavy advertising such as the nypost.  Also, the screen kept changing sizes and I could get it back to normal.

I believe this is by design,  Google wants you to use their Office products only.  Google docs and Google sheets are terrible and inferior to Microsoft office.I do not like Microsoft windows computers, they are buggy and unreliable and have major security issues.

B097WD9P4K,Samsung-Electronics-Galaxy-Chromebook-i3-Processor,A great Chromebook that's often overlooked.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2022","This is a great Chromebook that's overlooked, due to some harsh and biased reviews out there on the web and YouTube. Thankfully, some of the more objective reviews made some good points and pointed out certain things about this device that made it appealing to me. That combined with the fact it was on sale when I was considering it sealed the deal for me.Some things about this device to note:- Build: Very good, aluminium base and lid with a high quality plastic deck which has been colour matched very well. I got the red and it does have hues of orange here and there, which I like. No creaking but there's a slight flex when holding it at one corner, but it's barely noticeable.- Keyboard: A bit shallow but the keys are a good size and has a nice typing feel to it. I find it enjoyable to use and I'm fairly accurate with it. It's backlit too, with a nice subtle glow.- Speakers: Not very rich in sound, but the sound is clear and sounds good for a device with this profile. It is down firing though.- Touchpad: a bit small, but definitely useable with a nice click and the surface is smooth since it's glass. So thumbs up there.- Webcam: The webcam is 720 and not very good but will do the job, I guess.- Screen: The screen is very nice, it's plenty sharp in this form factor with good colours and deep blacks with great viewing angles.- Battery: Battery life is good, I think I average around 7 to 8 hours. I could probably get 10 out of it if I manage the screen brightness a bit more.- Peformance: This is a 10th gen i3 with 8gb of RAM and while most would say that it's not as good as the 11th gen, this is still a well performing machine. I run multiple tabs at once and the machine remains nice and snappy while using it so performance is very good. It also runs very quiet, I can barely tell the fan is running at times.-Ports: Port selection isn't great, the device only has the two usb c ports on either side but there is an SD card slot to expand the storage plus a headphone jack, which is nice. I invested in a little USB-C hub to provide USB-A and HDMI ports.I would definitely recommend this device and I would buy it again, especially at the discounted price but even when buying it at the full price, it's still a great machine that many would be happy with I think.(I almost forgot to mention, for anyone wondering, mine didn't ship with the massive black sticker on the left of the trackpad that I saw in some reviews, so seems the retail versions don't have it since it's almost impossible to remove cleanly).",4.0 out of 5 stars,Clint.S,53 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,2,1

B097WD9P4K,Samsung-Electronics-Galaxy-Chromebook-i3-Processor,Keyboard and Monitor are different colors!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2022","The review from Svdg50 was a red flag (no pun intended), however I was hoping the problem was isolated to international shipments as I didn't see any mention in the domestic reviews. Not the case! I just received my fiesta red chromebook and the monitor is what I believe is supposed to be the fiesta red color but the keyboard frame is obviously a different color (more of an orange hue). This issue doesn't appear to be isolated to the Samsung Amazon store either, because I just drove to BestBuy (CA location) and their floor model has the same issue! I can't find any other reference online to the fiesta red being two different colors intentionally, but all of the pictures on Samsung's, Amazon's, and BestBuy's website show a chromebook with one uniform red color.I don't know if Samsung is trying to offload old inventory, but if Samsung's lying about the external components, it calls into question the quality of the internal components. It's possible the Chromebook will be amazing despite the aesthetic, but this rating reflects the abhorrent false advertising going on.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Michelle,6 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,3,1

B097WD9P4K,Samsung-Electronics-Galaxy-Chromebook-i3-Processor,Experience versatility and power with the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 360,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2022","As a frequent traveler, I was in need of a reliable, lightweight, and portable computing device that could keep up with my busy lifestyle. That's where the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 comes in.Right out of the box, I was immediately impressed by the Chromebook 2's sleek and stylish design. The Fiesta Red color option is a nice touch, giving it a unique look that stands out from the sea of boring silver laptops. And at just 2.7 lbs, it's lightweight and easy to carry with me wherever I go.But it's not just about the looks - the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 also packs a powerful punch. The 13.3"" Full HD touchscreen display is crisp and vibrant, making it a joy to use for streaming movies or browsing the web. And the 10th Gen Intel Core i3 processor and 8 GB of RAM ensure smooth and responsive performance, even when running multiple applications at once.But what really sets the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 apart is its 2-in-1 design. I can use it as a traditional laptop for typing up documents or taking notes, or flip the screen around and use it as a tablet for presenting to a group or watching movies on the go. This versatility is a game-changer for someone like me who is constantly on the move.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2. It's a reliable, feature-packed device that meets all my computing needs, and the 2-in-1 design is a major bonus. The only thing I wish it had is a built-in stylus. If you're in need of a versatile and portable computing device, I highly recommend giving the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 a try.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sean Dalrymple,6 people found this helpful,,4,1

Avoid this otherwise excellent Chromebook.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2021","This is beautiful and very capable lightweight Chromebook. Unfortunately, I can not recommend it. It's too fragile.The screen cracked within 3 months of normal at-home use. I am not a road-warrior. The device was never dropped. There was no trauma. But screen cracks are not covered by the warranty. So it cost $365 to repair through Samsung.The screen and bezel panel is very thin by design. It exhibits a small amount of flex in regular use. The tension created from regularly opening and closing the screen is too much for the design. (There are no protective cases available for this model to give it more rigidity or protection.)So either get an extended warranty that covers screen damage or forget it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,RichardL,66 people found this helpful,,4,1
B097WD9P4K,Samsung-Electronics-Galaxy-Chromebook-i3-Processor,2 major problems: multicolour body and poor google chrome integration (crazy!!!!),"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2022","I would love this laptop if there was not two major problems, that can happen to you too. First, I've received an item that has TWO colours, an orange part and a red part. Ridiculous. Dear Samsung, please contact me to fix this.The second point shocked me most. Say you are on a pc or mac, using chrome. You've got a personal (google) and a professional (google suite) account. You're used to switch between both with ease. It matters because one account has company data on it, and the other may have personal passwords. Now you get a chromebook like this one, thinking it's going to be super well integrated. NO IT'S NOT! In a chromebook, you login in the computer with say, your google account. If you choose to log-in with your company google suite account, and it's not an ENTERPRISE licence which costs an additional 50 USD per year, then you CANNOT ""enroll"" the laptop in your google suite account. Because you cannot enroll, you cannot install anything from google play, including VPN or any other app. Useless!Now if you login in your personal account, and then from within, add your professional login, well you've got a chrome that is synced to your personal account, you can add apps, but you can't access whatever else is supposed to be synced on your pro account, such as passwords! What a mess. No way around it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Svdg50,11 people found this helpful,,4,1

B0C8MYQRGB,BiTECOOL-Windows-i3-5005U-Display-Battery,Very good for what it is.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024","I'm rating this as a 5 based on what it is. This is not a powerhouse or gaming computer. It has a dual-core i3 chip which is just enough to accommodate simple tasks. I picked this up as a travel computer so that, if something happened to it, I'm not out of a lot of money.If you want something fast with lots of cores that can handle gaming and/or other CPU/GPU-intensive apps, this won't meet your needs. If your needs are more modest, this may do the trick.All I'm looking to do with it is check email, browse the web, watch videos, etc., while I'm away from home. I can imagine it being an adequate student laptop for a family on a budget.That said, it has a decent feature set, considering what you pay for it. The operating system (Windows 11 Pro) is not activated, though it is mostly functional. You can't personalize the display, and it nags you about activating.Because it's not activated, you don't require (and cannot use) a Microsoft account. You create an account that isn't tied to your normal Microsoft stuff. I can't use One Drive, for example, but that isn't what I care about with this machine.You can activate Windows, of course, which (at the time of this posting) will set you back about $300 USD. However, if you want a fully activated Windows laptop at some point down the road, you've spread out the cost over time. It's an interest-free loan in that case (though who knows if the price of activation will go up in the meantime).It has plenty of ports (3 USB including type C, HDMI, micro SD, wired headphone/mic jack, and a dedicated LAN port). I like that last one, as you can use WiFi or a physical cable to connect to a router.The keyboard is full-sized and, so far, has held up to simple use. Same with the trackpad.It comes with WPS (a free alternative to Microsoft Office), which I haven't used, but it should do fine for basic tasks (word processing, spreadsheet, presentation). As far as I can tell, it uses the Office file formats (docx, for example), so it should be reasonably compatible.I haven't had an occasion to print anything with the laptop, so I can't speak to that.It comes with 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD.

Here is my honest feedback: It’s great! The keyboard works, screen shorts, camera, speakers, etc. Although, I will most likely have to get a battery replace because the battery only lasts 4-5 hours on a full charge.The weight is very light, very easy to use and travel with.

I chose a refurbished model because I did not want to contribute to the ongoing genocide in the Congo related to mining of materials for tech devices. Unfortunately, this MacBook screen has been shutting off without notice since the day I got it. Sometimes it stays on for the whole time I am using it, other times, it shuts off in the middle of my class despite being in use, having no apparent sleep or screen preferences that would indicate such behavior, and without any ability to turn back on. It seems to come back without any input from me. The computer itself is not dead, I can hear the buttons being pushed and it allows shutting off. It’s currently not turning back on despite having saved school work on it that I won’t be able to retrieve before sending it back to be returned. I am now in the position of having to scramble to buy another computer hastily so I can take an in-person exam next week.

It has a couple small scratches and a dent (pictured) and the battery does say “service recommended” (which doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong, just that the battery is on the older side) but for a four year old computer I’d say that isn’t a dealbreaker. I’ve been using this MacBook Air regularly for about a week and I’ve had no issues and the battery does hold while streaming video for about 3 - 4 hours. I haven’t attempted any gaming which I’d imagine is where you’d see lagging and battery drain, but for my needs it’s pretty much perfect (a sticker will easily cover the small scratches). Years ago I bought this same model new and it cost me well over $1,000, so for less than half that I’d say it’s worth it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bri,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

B09BK21GFW,Apple-MacBook-1-1GHz-13-inch-Storage,"works well, but came with wrong charger","Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2022","Shipping took a bit longer than expected and it was shipped via FedEx which made me nervous because FedEx tends to lose packages with tech contents. But, they delivered this one without requiring my signature or anything, they just put the box in front of the door.The laptop came in a big box and it was just sort of loose in there with a generic charger. I turned the laptop on and the battery was at about 70-80% charged. The laptop so far, works well. I installed all my work programs on it and everything runs well. Then the battery was running low, so I plugged it in. The computer continued to work but it stated ""Battery not charging"". I tried shutting it down and turning it back on...nothing. Then I tried a different USB-C cable that I have that connects to a USB outlet and it finally charged but super slowly. I checked the charger and it's 85W. The MacBook Air uses a 30W. It shouldn't really impact charging of the battery with a higher powered charger so I'm confused why it's not charging. I tried a few different outlets and it works in some outlets but not all. I wrote the seller and they said they'd forward my concern to the proper department. We shall see. I can't comment too much on battery life yet since I just finally got it fully charged but I felt that it drained pretty quickly from 70% to almost 0% but I was also installing and running a bunch of programs.From the outward appearance, the MacBook Air is in great condition. I was a bit nervous from reading some reviews where there was significant damage. This one has one little scratch on one of the sides but that's it. display, keyboard and trackpad are in excellent condition and looks like new.If we get the charger situation resolved then it was definitely a good purchase and I'd recommend it as you can save a few hundred dollars by buying a ""renewed"" computer.Just updating my review. I took the computer to the apple store and it was determined that the charger was not working properly. So, I purchased an apple charger. The seller has given me a partial refund for about half the coast of the charger, which is fine. The apple store also ran diagnostics on the laptop and said everything is in good shape.Overall, happy with the purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars,verena,11 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,2,2

B09BK21GFW,Apple-MacBook-1-1GHz-13-inch-Storage,Good value for a college student without high-power needs!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2022","Processor-wise, this MacBook Air isn’t a powerhouse, or blazingly fast. But it upgraded to Ventura 13.0.1 just fine, so it’s as current as can be for MacOS now (pro tip - always upgrade your MacOS when buying a refurb, as it more than likely won’t be current since it was shipped from a shelf, I’d bet).This laptop is definitely as advertised, so big kudos to the supplier. Screen is clean, and case and screen are scratch-free. Keyboard has the normal somewhat shiny keys here and there (finger oil, usually), so a delicate cleaning with isopropyl usually helps restore as good as it’ll get (which, again here is pretty good and no more than expected). My son, who’s in college, uses mostly cloud-based school apps and Google docs, so horsepower isn’t a big need. And he’s a Nintendo Switch guy for gaming, so I never get the IT Support call for slow laptop when trying to destroy his gaming enemy (thank God). I moved him from an 11” MacBook, which was an OS or 2 locked behind (and apparently dropped more than once, but he won’t come clean there), so even though that was actually fine horsepower-wise still, this one will give him a few more years, plus save me some $ towards his Masters (ugg) degree.

B09BK21GFW,Apple-MacBook-1-1GHz-13-inch-Storage,I'm a PC guy....yet I freaking love this Mac,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2022","For YEARS (maybe even decades now) I've been heavily against buying Macs....they were always waaaaaaaay too expensive for what you got.  And even for creatives you can get a top of the line PC that can also play games at the cost of most Macs.But now....the M1 generation is here to change everything.  This thing only cost me around $1,200 and it can edit photos and video with 0 issues, EVEN 4K FOOTAGE!It runs forever, it rarely ever skips when working....it just freaking works....like flawlessly.I'm also glad to see that Apple took the route of making this thing a beast, but giving it one glaring flaw which I'm fine with to keep the cost down....that flaw is the HD space.This thing has only freaking 250GB in it which is almost nothing in this day and age for creatives....mine as well have given me 50GB lol.  So having an external HD attached to this thing 24/7 is a must, but that's a price I'm willing to pay for this.I recommend this to any photographer/videographer that doesn't need a daily driver Mac to edit with.  When I say Daily Driver, I mean a computer that you use for everything, for going on FB, playing games, work, etc, etc.  I personally ONLY use this for editing and it's perfect for that.If you need a daily driver Mac then consider one of the Pro or Max series because you'll have more power and more space to do what you need.

I was trying to decide between the Air or Pro version and decided the Air.. i’ve been using it for about 5 days and yesterday it was making sounds but the screen wouldn’t come on..it was charged and plugged in but the screen was dead. I tried force restarting it and different things and nothing would work. but finally it eventually turned on..then today my computer kept freezing and glitching and apps wouldn’t close and safari wouldn’t work. I mean it’s definitely better than my old MacBook Air but it’s not worth spending $600 on tbh. I should have paid a few more hundred for a brand new one from Apple.

B0BTQWR77M,Laptop-1920x1200-Display-i7-1355U-SFG14-71T-72QV,Don't bother with the Core Ultra; this unit is great,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024","It's still very early days so I can't comment on durability yet. But I will provide some opinions and commentary.This Acer Swift Go 14 replaced a new Asus Zenbook 14 with OLED screen and Core Ultra 155h. The Asus arrived with a defective touchpad so it went back to BestBuy.So enough history. I had been lusting after this Acer unit  for quite a number of months so, when the Asus went south and Amazon dropped the price on the Acer, I ordered it. It arrived in two days (as promised). Came with a zippered case (which I haven't even opened yet).Forgot that it had a touchscreen; I'll never use it as the screen doesn't fold back into tablet mode so it's essentially worthless to me; they could have left it out and sold it for less. I guess everybody wants an iPad wannabe, eh?The screen itself, however, is sharp and clear and very bright. I tend to keep it at 50% brightness as I computer indoors. The 1920x1200 resolution is perfect. I keep it at 125% magnification and can read the small lettering just fine with my glasses.The keyboard has plenty of key travel (unlike MacBooks) and the touchpad, which I don't think is a Synaptics, operates well. It's not oversized (as Macs tend to be) but feels right to me. Tapping, two-finger scrolling, three- and four-finger swipes are supported (as is a traditional ""click"" if you press).Performance: Very speedy; feels as fast if not faster than the Asus Zenbook I returned. If I could install Windows 10, I might do that only because Win11 gets in my way with its incessant nagging and suggesting and whining. Maybe when I figure out how to turn off all the annoyances, I'll be happier with Win11.General Design: One of the things I've liked about Acer non-gaming laptops/notebooks is their ""vanilla"" design ethos. Keep it simple and clean. The case of this Swift is a lovely somewhat squared-off ""chiseled"" look in the same sense as an Ioniq 5. I think the manufacturing execution is not quite Apple quality--the case port edges are a little sharper than Apple would permit--but everything plugs in the way it should. The keyboard is recessed below the palm rest a bit so your greasy fingers won't end up leaving marks on the screen when you close the lid. Speaking of the keyboard, it's nice and large with well-spaced keys and adequate backlighting.Battery life: Ran it for about 6+ hours with lots of web use. I think I had about 50% left. No complaints.As I think about it, the Acer reminds me most of my 13"" 2012 MacBook Pro although it's a larger screen, higher resolution, incredibly faster, and about 1.25 lbs lighter. :D That Mac was, IMHO, the pinnacle of Mac laptop design. I think Acer has done a great job with this unit.I'll report back in a few months regarding any QC issues that, hopefully, won't pop up.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rumplestiltskin,15 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2
B0BTQWR77M,Laptop-1920x1200-Display-i7-1355U-SFG14-71T-72QV,The Most Versatile and Portable Windows Laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2024","This is the closest I've seen a Windows laptop get to being a MacBook replica. The portability, performance, weight, and overall ease of use make this laptop an all-around option depending on what you are looking for. The laptop includes a wall adapter with a fixed USB-C cable for charging in addition to support documents and limited warranty information.When first setting up the laptop, I did have to plug it into power as the battery was out of charge on arrival, but within a few minutes I was able to power it on and begin the setup process. The setup is the same routine questions and answers on most laptops, but this one does have some extra bloatware preinstalled- namely the Acer apps and McAfee Antivirus. The setup also gives you the option to set up your fingerprint if you would like additional security, which is baked into the power button. The process here is simple and it is the same process as adding your fingerprint on a phone, however, the power button can be pressed easily when doing this, so do it gently.Once the setup is complete, you'll be in Windows and ready to start using the laptop. The default wallpaper is an Acer one, and you will have some pop ups from McAfee asking you to set up or extend your subscription. I recommend uninstalling these apps and any others you may not use in addition to also disabling OneDrive as it will free up some of the resources from being used up by the unwanted programs. The laptop also has a few USB ports for connecting your devices in addition to the headphone jack, HDMI port, and a MicroSD card reader. For expanded use, I recommend using a docking station to get even more versatility out of this laptop.The laptop itself runs without issue, and the built-in display is bright enough for my normal everyday usage although it can appear dim when using it outdoors or in brightly lit areas. The screen is also very colorful and doesn't have any issues with the picture washing out or distorting when looking at it from an angle, and the integrated touch screen works flawlessly whether I use my fingertips or a capacitive stylus. My only complaint about the display is that it is limited to 60hz, which can make scrolling or moving things across the screen feel choppy and sluggish at times but that's coming from someone who uses 144hz+ displays most of the time. Most people will be more than okay with that frame rate. Additionally, the speakers on this laptop are surprisingly good. The speakers are rich and full sounding without the hollow, harsh sharp sounds that you typically get when listening to voices or watching online content. They still don't have the same level of depth and detail as a pair of headphones or dedicated speakers, but they will be more than enough for the average person.As far as the performance of the laptop goes, it works really well. The performance cores of this i7 chip don't always like to engage which is fairly noticeable when watching streamed content such as videos or scrolling through e-books or news articles, but once you open a more demanding application, such as a game or editing software, the CPU will boost higher and the laptop will feel more smooth. The internal SSD also helps this laptop to boot up extremely quickly, as I find myself on the Windows login screen within 15-20 seconds every time I power it on from its shutoff state, and if it's asleep from just having the lid closed, it will wake up immediately when lifting the lid. The laptop on its own can handle almost everything you throw at it. It can run almost any online game without issue and it can also stream most online content without any lag or hitching with the exception of the occasional jitter if you try to load videos in 4K resolution. The internal graphics on the CPU can also run a large amount of older games at lower resolutions and detail settings, which also help give this laptop a lot of capabilities despite its small and narrow design. When running non-intensive tasks, the laptop is virtually whisper silent, and even under load it does not get as loud as I was expecting. However, my favorite part of this laptop is the Thunderbolt USB-C ports. These USB-C ports are special compared to other USB-C ports as the Thunderbolt technology allows you to not only use either of these ports to charge the laptop, but if you get a docking station as mentioned, you can charge the laptop, power a mouse and keyboard, output an image on another display, read SD card files, and much more just with that one Thunderbolt port. Not only that, if you are a gamer, you can use these Thunderbolt ports in conjunction with a GPU enclosure, which will allow you to play newer AAA video games on your laptop by just connecting an external GPU to the Thunderbolt port on the laptop. Despite the small design of the laptop, the Intel i7 chip pairs nicely with my older RTX 3070 when connected to a GPU enclosure, and I can play any game from my Steam library if I choose. Don't get too excited though, as this feature does require both a GPU enclosure and a GPU to put inside of it, but I am just telling you how versatile this laptop can get if you had the extra equipment.Lastly, the battery life on this laptop is absolutely stunning in how long it lasts. Whenever you simply close the lid and let the laptop rest in idle, it barely sips power and can last for days in standby without losing much battery life at all. Additionally, the battery charges fast when needed, and since it uses USB-C for power, as long as you have an adapter and cable rated for higher wattages, this makes the laptop easier to find a substitute charger for if you ever misplace the original. In normal use, I can easily get a full day or longer out of this laptop before it needs to be recharged if I am using it continuously, but it can last much longer as mentioned if I only use it for a couple hours here and there.Overall, this is an exceptionally versatile laptop that can be easily taken on the go or left at home on a desk to do all the things you need. Need to finish a college essay while eating brunch at a coffee shop? It'll do that. Want to sit at home, relax and watch your favorite content creators? It will do that too. No matter how you need or want to use it, it will do the job. Whether it's for productivity, gaming, entertainment, etc, it's the first Windows laptop of its class that I can genuinely say I would use on a regular basis. I highly recommend it!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Realm of Nova,26 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

A swift go 14. I used the laptop on my lap enough that the snid has a missing digit where the sticker is wrinkled. Magic disappearing ink. No help from manufacturer product support without 11 digits. Mine as 10. The ACER product support agent said amazon will have the snid on record.  Have you ever tried to contact Amazon?  Just beat your head against the wall. I can't find a way to get the info I need. My warranty is good for 5 more months but it's worthless without the snid. Amazon services is the seller. I guess the lesson here is don't buy anything you really need and aren't prepared to throw away from Amazon. My price was just under $800 at the time. Another expensive lesson from Amazon just like the $400 taco pump that died in 35 days and the seller on Amazon said tough luck.  Those carry a 1 year warranty as well.  See the pattern?  There is no warranty or help from Amazon for any purchase. I forgot the vac I bought that was supposed to have 2 aluminum sections but came with 1 and the seller had me take pictures and send them but never helped. It's perfect for a child who stands 3' tall. Never used... anybody want a deal?

B0BTQWR77M,Laptop-1920x1200-Display-i7-1355U-SFG14-71T-72QV,"OK, but not much value in it","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2023","I guess I was expecting a better performing computer... that being said, it is good for a first computer for someone in school that just needs a fast computer to do homework and play some games.PROS:  fast to start, open and close programs.  Very good screen. Large storage capacity and Memory (RAM). and very light weigh which is good for carrying it around.CONS: Short battery life -only lasts 5 - 6 hours (longer if the computer is not active). The advertised 12 hours battery life is why I bought this computer but it falls way short and I'm disappointed with this. The mouse pad is too sensitive and works erraticly if you are not careful (this probably has to do with my heavy handed actions. The keyboard feels rough to the touch and you have to depress the keys kind of hard... this is ok by me except the keys are loud (at least louder than my old hp elitebook computer).  Finally, the screen does not go past 105-110 degrees (this lack of flexibility does not allow me to work from my bed or when I'm doing Yoga and have to find the a better position for the screen).I'm glad I bought this computer at a discount on Black Friday, otherwise I would have returned it immediately.  Would I recomend this computer?  The answer is only if you buy it for less than $500 taxes included... I bought mine for $640 plus taxes and I feel I overpaid!

It seems to run faster than my current model Dell XPS with an i5 processor. The touchscreen is very response and bright. The only thing that I would be critical of is the sound quality - it is tinny.

B0BTQWR77M,Laptop-1920x1200-Display-i7-1355U-SFG14-71T-72QV,"Very good value, some tiny issues","Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2024","I must say for the money you're paying for this laptop, it's very good. I picked it up mainly for educational and work purposes to take notes, write code, and do light gaming. Under the battery-saving power plan, the laptop can last nearly 10 hours. That's with me writing code, texting people, surfing the web, and listening to music. The RAM is enough to do all those things (and in the future if it isn't you can always upgrade it easily).In terms of performance, I've had no complaints. This is not a gaming machine and does not have a dedicated GPU. However, you can most definitely game smoothly on even fairly recent titles if you don't care too much about graphics (I play GTA V with a graphics mod and NFS Heat with very high graphics settings and they both run smoothly).The touch screen works as you would expect. Same with the fingerprint reader being very quick. The keyboard is nice to type with, so no issues there. It being backlit is also a nice touch.There are just a couple of small things that bother me which are honestly not a big deal and I've found some workarounds for them. The screen brightness doesn't go very high, so using the laptop outdoors in the sun will definitely be difficult, outside of the fact that you're also using more of your battery life. The keyboard was missing multimedia keys, which very much surprised me since I've never had a computer missing those. To fix it I simply linked them through a shortcut on Windows and while it's a little inconvenient, it still does the job. I get quite concerned about the heat of the laptop. If you are putting it on performance mode, it can get quite hot. Not loud, just hot. There also is no way I could find for me to modify the fan curves so I'm stuck with whatever speed the fans want to run at. The laptop doesn't get hot on casual use, but if you're say for example gaming, it gets concerning. I generally suggest having a CPU temp monitor if you do plan on gaming so that you can keep a check on your temperature and ideally try to keep it under 90 degrees Celcius. You can always use Core Temp to alert you when your CPU gets hot so you can turn down your settings a bit.Do get a lot of network issues with it though. WIFI happens to mess off quite often.Again, I really enjoy using this laptop and find it to be an amazing choice for this price point.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Khosraw Azizi,11 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2
B0BTQWR77M,Laptop-1920x1200-Display-i7-1355U-SFG14-71T-72QV,Solid Laptop with a Secret,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2023","I'm going to college soon and I needed a laptop, so I settled on this one after looking at a bunch of reviews. So far, it's proven itself to be pretty powerful with a high end CPU, and I also find the backlit keyboard to be a big help when it's dark.I can't comment on battery life since I haven't used it that much, but after calibrating the battery it usually estimates itself at 9+ hours at max charge, though I have it on a lower performance setting. Will come back to update after I toil in academia.Anyways, you've probably already seen the pictures connected to this review so the secret is out, but apparently this laptop has a secret 2nd M.2 Slot hidden next to the fans. Just disconnect the ribbon cable and peel the black tape away, and there it is. Perfectly functional too. I installed a 1TB Crucial P3 Plus with a thermal pad so the ribbon cable doesn't heat up, and after a restart I managed to initialize the new SSD and now have another TB of space in this thing.It's a little strange that they decided to hide away this slot and not say a word about it even though doing so would make it an even more appealing product, I only know of this because I stumbled upon a disassembly video of the laptop in question and someone brought it up in the comments.Anyways, the only reason I'm giving this laptop a 4 star review despite all of my praises is the fact that the 16 gigs of RAM are soldered to the laptop. While it's a perfectly functional amount there's almost no reason manufacturers should be soldering RAM apart from guaranteeing that laptops like these become obsolete even faster.EDIT 2/16/2024:I'm well into my second semester now, so I figured I'd come back to write an update as promised.Honestly, I'm not super impressed with this laptop's performance despite the high end CPU. My classes tend to require the use of various Adobe programs such as Photoshop and InDesign, and sometimes the laptop will just slow to a crawl or threaten to just crash when I'm saving my work. I have experimented with going out of power efficiency mode but I don't think it's had much of an effect.On the bright side, the battery is able to last for a whole day (some days I go from 9:00 to 6:40) and then some, though I do take the chance to charge it whenever I'm near an outlet. Even then, the thing will charge pretty dang fast (60% to 100% in half an hour). Unfortunately the provided charger ended up breaking my last semester so I had to invest in a third party 65W brick.It's also pretty dang light too at about 2.75 pounds (1.25kg), and I do really like the all metal sleek build. The double thunderbolt USB-C ports is a cool idea, though I haven't ever really needed to use both, and my SD card reader doesn't fit the other slot if I'm charging. MicroSD is cool too, but my DSLR uses SD cards so that's another feature not utilized.I'm still pretty bummed out about how limited this thing's performance is by the soldered ram, and I've also come to realize I don't actually use much of the 1TB I added when I upgraded it. Worse yet, I'm not much of a visuals guy and I always keep this thing on night light mode so I'm likely not doing the display justice. Though I do find the touchscreen to be helpful at times.As I'm writing this review it's on sale for $599, and I paid $690 initially. Would I recommend this laptop? I mean, the battery life is great, it's lightweight and all metal, and does have some cool features like thunderbolt ports, microSD, and a good display. If all of that sounds appealing and you won't be doing anything crazy like intensive gaming, right now it seems like a good deal. As for me, I'll probably give this to my sister and continue my search for my one true laptop.Also, the provided case's zipper ended up breaking off at some point.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Peter,72 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

For the money, this is a steal.I bought this laptop for work.Windows uses a technique called Fast Boot to save some information from your last use of the machine to shorten the time to startup for the current use.  Many security updates need a complete reboot.  I turn Fast Boot off to make sure the machine has the latest updates to protect company data.  That comes with a cost of slower startups.A SSD with enough RAM can result in really fast startups, even when Fast Boot is turned off.  I can turn this computer on and be on the internet in 30 seconds.The fingerprint reader and touchscreen work great.I have not pushed the battery down to 10% yet.  But I have used it down to 40% in a few hours.  I don't think this battery will last all day if you are continually using it.

The heat can also be felt through the keyboard deck on the left side of the laptop so keep that in mind.Keyboard: typing has been comfortable for me, no complaintsConnections: plenty of ports on the laptop but do keep in mind that the USB C ports do not support display out so you are stuck with the HDMI.Performance: I do sometimes see lag when doing normal tasks like opening menus and windows but this doesn't happen all the time. Numbers wise the laptop is probably plenty fast for most things you throw at it.Speakers: terrible, they are way too soft in my opinion for media consumption but I did notice they sound fine for conference calls. Just be mindful of what you are purchasing this unit for. I also found it helpful to download a 3rd party software to force higher volume levels and provide better equalization.Camera: good quality, can't complainMic: seems to be fine but i did notice that during calls people would sometimes here feedback/echoing from the speakers (still not sure why this happens).Build quality: it's aluminium but looks and feels more like rigid plastic.Weight: I think it weighs about as much as my MacBook air, it's just a bit thicker so definitely not a heavy laptop.",3.0 out of 5 stars,rick smith,4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,2,2

And the junkiest speakers.  But it worked at home, at work, got transported in a backpack, and still runs, even if it crashes with too many tabs open, using Linux Mint.My Acer Spin 3 ran Fedora, seemed great as what I think is called a ""budget"" ultrabook, but had a screen failure in under a year. Not cool.Just tried Debian on this Swift 3 Evo.  Explored BIOS first but not sure I needed to change anything.  Downloaded Debian using my aspire, right clicked to make it bootable onto a thumb drive, and then installed debian to the swift.  For wifi, selecting our network didn't work, but leaving it blank, it accepted the password.  Weird.  However, after install, it said I didn't have a wifi card.  I spent some hours trying to get some wifi drive, couldn't find clear procedure, and gave up.  Got Linux Vanilla, installed, and, it worked fine, so far.Time will tell if this Swift lasts like the Aspire, or dies like the Spin, so I'm not gonna give this a bunch of stars yet.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Flip Phone 808,,Verified Purchase,2,2

The one thing I like that I thought was not important but the keyboard  lights come on as soon as I touch any key.  When the room is dark, it means I don't need to struggle to see the keys or turn on a light.  It is silly but I like  it.It connects to my TV with no problem and quickly.So far, so good.  I have had it for a few days.  I hope to come back and write again after a few months.8/12 Okay so the camera is not able to do ""windows hello"" and the battery will only charge to 80% unless you go to Care Center and slide a toggle to fix that. go to check up and there are 3 little pages for battery, on the second page, slide the toggle switch and you will get 100% charge.  I still like this quick little machine!Oct 8th, I still love this light weight computer, I have had no problems and I use it at least 4-6 hours a day.  The windows hello issue is happily not needed because the fingerprint reader is perfect!  No really, it is in the power button and it reads me every time.  I had someone else try it to make sure is was really just my fingerprint to be read, and it rejected the other person.I use a once a week Zoom call, What's app video calls and I have no problems with this sharp camera.  Movies don't hang while I watch, and I still love the lighted keys.  If the room is dark I just tap any key and the light comes on and goes off when not in use.

I play mainly TF2 and SCP:SL and they run with decent FPS on the laptop, even though it’s depending on the low settings mainly. Works great with Minecraft, considering that the laptop has 16GB of RAM.Barely takes 10 seconds to boot up and the fingerprint scanner is nice. Just press the power button and hold it for a second to log in. I haven’t really had it unplugged but the times I did just for typing documents and watching videos I could say the battery lasts for around 6-8 hours, great for college.Only real thing id say is mediocre with the laptop is the backlights for the keyboard. I didn’t really look but they kinda have a mind of their own. I’m sure there’s settings for them but I don’t really mind them turning off every thirty seconds.Brightness is fine. Haven’t yet been outside with it so I couldn’t say with seeing it outside, but I would say it would be fine.Really lightweight. I didn’t have any laptops before this but I can tell regardless it’s nice to be lightweight.Don’t really use the touchscreen but I’ll look at utilizing it.

First it is not thin and light compared to actual thin and light computers.  The most irritating thing is the keyboard is practically useless for more than one word.  The cursor regularly jumps back into previous text... and you end up typing at that spot and having to correct over and over.  Typing this paragraph took about three times longer than it should because.  I thought about adding a separate keyboard but the defeats the whole purpose of a laptop.

Was really looking forward to it. The value on paper looks great. Generation 14 Intel CPU with Intel Arc video card capabilities, 16 GB of ram, 512 GB of SSD, OLED display.I don't know if I just happen to get a bad sample but my experience with this laptop was completely unsatisfactory. Killer wireless Wi-Fi has always been worthless since they came out years ago but I was willing to give it a try on this laptop. Wi-fi proved to be completely unstable. Huge latency spikes, barely able to pick up Wi-Fi where my Android phone and old laptop got very strong signal. Killer Wi-Fi card actually crashed and disappeared from the device manager several times as if the laptop suddenly didn't know it had a Wi-Fi card.Continuing to use the system didn't prove any better. There was a weird hesitancy when opening any program even simple things like the command line prompt, notepad, or opening an additional tab in a web browser. There was always a two to 4 second delay after attempting any of those, to the point I was wondering if it actually accepted the mouse click and was going to launch the program and it finally would.Other programs would just outright crash with error codes and never even worked correctly. I insured everything was up to date including windows before starting to use the laptop.Aside from the fact that the HDR experience in Windows is just terrible, the colors on this screen were off. There was a significant bias towards red causing video and pictures to look really weird. Even when using it in regular SDR srgb color mode which is the default Windows color profile.Due to all the reasons above I just decided to return the laptop because it was a completely disappointing experience. I've had other Acer laptops in the past and have been satisfied, other family members have them as well. It's too bad because I was really looking forward to this new laptop. Ultimately I chose to return it to Amazon and get a full refund under the 30 day return guarantee.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Eric,6 people found this helpful,,9,2
B0BTQWR77M,Laptop-1920x1200-Display-i7-1355U-SFG14-71T-72QV,Happy!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2023","My computing needs are simple. I want a nice keyboard, high processing speeds, internet connectivity, a quality monitor display, and built in ports to connect my devices. If the computer is of a light weight, portable size, and long-lasting battery life, bonus! I work on the go and my computer travels with me. I was glad to take the Acer Swift Go 14 for a test drive, excited I was given the opportunity to experience this product and write a review for Amazon Vine.I'll start by noting the bells and whistles. The Acer Swift Go 14 comes equipped with a touch screen. If you like being able to minimize windows, close browser tabs, and navigate with a tap of your finger, the good news is that the touch screen works! You can scroll with a swipe of your index finger, pulling your browser up and down. You can zoom in with a pinch, or zoom out by creating an expanse between your thumb and index finger. You can pick stuff from a menu. You can drag and drop items. The touch screen is responsive. It can be used.This computer also comes equipped with fingerprint identification and security. If you encode your fingerprint and unlock your computer with a press of a button. Alternatively, you could stick with a PIN on the login screen. But if you like to make it zippy by holding your finger on the power button, you can zoom right into your homepage.If you're a Windows user, the operating system will be familiar. The defaults are unsurprisingly to the Microsoft suite of products. Bing is the default internet browser. If you prefer other software applications, you can purchase and install them from the Microsoft store. I installed Zoom, Evernote, Tidal, and the Amazon Prime desktop client, and all work great. I added cloud storage applications. This machine comes with a number of software packages installed that I have no plans of using--Forge of Empires, McAfee, XBox Game Bar, WhatsApp, Spotify, and others--that I've opted out of. Be ready for a few offers and ads with setup that you can take of leave.I've tried the on board camera and microphone with a couple of videoconferencing applications, and I'm pleased with the results. Smooth transmission, adequate pickup, and good video quality. This machine also comes with built-in Bluetooth capability, and has paired seamlessly with all but one of my devices, an older Logitech mouse. That was disappointing. On the plus side, I contacted Acer tech support to help me with the connectivity troubles, and I had a great experience with the technician on the other end of the chat. Acer's tech support team will be there for you while the machine is under warranty. Once the warranty expires, you pay for support (as with many other products).Lastly, I'll comment on battery life. It's more than enough for me. Mileage will vary, depending on your usage. But when I've got it running, whether web-surfing, typing away, or streaming, I'm pleased with the battery life, and with the fact that the computer doesn't run too hot.I'll finish where I began. My computing needs are simple. This computer meets those needs. I'm happy with my experience. I'm happy with how this things runs, with how it feels, and how it performs. I recommend it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Benjamin A. Simpson,17 people found this helpful,,10,2
B0BTQWR77M,Laptop-1920x1200-Display-i7-1355U-SFG14-71T-72QV,"Nicely spec'ed machine, Win 11 is very fast, linux has wifi issues","Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2023","This is a really wonderful laptop, Im really impressed coming from M1 Apple laptops.The screen is a high res 1920x1200 on a 14"" screen with pretty high DPI, which is quite nice considering some of the low res budget screens that are available. Also nice is that the screen tilts back very far and has a nice little feature that lifts the base of the laptop off the desk when opened to allow airflow.The laptop is very fast, surprisingly so for basic tasks, with the I7 processor, but still lasts for hours. It comes with 16gb which is almost a requirement for windows now, but at least they didn't cheap out and stick 8gb in. this is especially important as the Ram isn not upgradable.Also comes with 512 gb of storage which has a standard NVME port if you want to expand it.The windows 11 interface is quite a bit different than the win10 im used to but is easy enough to get around. I did install windows 10 as I wanted to get that older feel, but ran into issues with drivers, as there are no win10 specific drivers, all win11 which work, but they are all scripts run from command and not easily installed. There is a recovery drive, so I was able restore back to factory with all win11 devices working as expected.I like that it will charge with USBC and comes with a 65w charger, and it's a pretty modestly sized 65w charger at that.It has a good set of inputs, 2 thunderbolt ports, *2* usb A ports, which is unusual these days, HDMI and a microSD card port, which is odd as SD to micro are so easy, but 99% of my cards ARE micro anyway.The performance is pretty good, with Cinebench multicore coming up at 7100 which is very respectable for a light thin windows laptop. Geekbench 8100.Even at full use, the fans are Very quiet, you can barely hear them, so the 'twin cooling' works pretty well.Finger print reader works ok, Ive had a couple times where it wasn't accepting my finger but otherwise it's been good about 95% of the time.Keyboard is pretty nice, no issues, but the backlight is a great add on. Touch pad is better than other windows laptops I used before. Very nice to use. Touch screen is nice, the screen doesn't leave smudges so even using it, the screen stay clean.I did install Linux on it to test that out, and it went pretty well, except for the Bios having a built in raid controller which tripped up all the live CD installers until I found the control +S option in bios to turn off VMD. once I got past that, I was able to install Linux Mint, but I got tripped up by the intel Wifi card as that's not well supported, even in newer 5.x+ kernels. I ended up finding a fix and got it all working but it was not as simple as many other windows laptops, due to the win11 security.Overall, its taken the top seat of windows laptops, and will be go to for any windows or now linux mobile work.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Slvrscoobie,20 people found this helpful,,10,2
B0BTQWR77M,Laptop-1920x1200-Display-i7-1355U-SFG14-71T-72QV,A highly capable laptop for almost every common use and then some. A low price too!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2023","I am not a computer geek, but as a retired science-focused academic I’ve been using computers for my research for a long time, from mainframes to TRS-80s, using CPM, iOS, Windows, Linux and other operating systems on desktops, laptops, tablets, and several smartphones. I pay attention to hardware and its capabilities. I claim no expertise, but I have learned enough to know that advertising tends to brag about how wonderful a computer’s hardware is because such claims about technology sell. I get pulled in by that too, but most users should first ask themselves what they want to use a new computer for, what software they can use on it, and how fast it can get the job done. Instead, when I got this computer I got all hardware-related questions—How fast does this processor run? Can I change out the graphics or is it on board? Can I add more ram? The list goes on. The answers to such hardware questions are either in the Tech Specs or discussed well in reviews of the various components on other geek sites. Even early reviews of the Acer Swift Go 14 discuss how well the hardware components function together. As both single components or together, the hardware fares extremely well, but consider how you plan to use the Swift Go 14. If you are a high end gamer, you likely will find weaknesses, but if you use the Swift Go as most laptops are used, you’ll find the Swift Go 14 to be spectacular. Graphics are excellent for streaming video (and to answer a question I got, yes, the OLED screen does handle HDR as the specs tell you). They also run the Adobe Creative Suite products well and quickly, but I have never found a small laptop screen easy to use with Photoshop and just a touch pad, so I have a wireless mouse, but that is difficult for me even with the image zoomed in. But I probably won’t  do much image manipulation on the small screen of the Swift Go’s 14 inch screen, but I will use Acrobat a lot. It runs Microsoft 365 products exceedingly well. The camera is spectacularly good for virtual presentations, meetings, or just chatting with friends on Team, Zoom, Skype, whatever. I can run my high end GIS and photogrammetry software without problems and fast, which is important for my  fieldwork. The audio is adequate, but not terrific. Battery power is better than most laptops  I’ve used except when high end graphics programs are running. You get an extremely capable laptop that hands-down, beats my Inspiron laptop, and at low price. The ergonomics are pretty good. It is very light and thin, which for travel and fieldwork is important. Yet, it has a solid feel to it. Acer says the Swift Go 14 has twin fans for cooling and runs cooler than most other laptops. Yeah, that’s hardware, and it’s true. I can sit with the laptop running on my lap for an hour and barely feel any heat. However, I feel significant  heat from my old laptop within minutes. I truly value the biometric sign in  via touchscreen or the keyboard power button. I have developed one dislike. Next to the hinges is a small protrusion that I assume is meant to protect the case, but it starts to dig into my leg after a time (see the pic attached). Would that keep me from buying this laptop? Not a chance! For the moment, the Acer Swift Go 14 does everything I want, and then some. This laptop is a wonder for both function and price!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Oneotaljz,16 people found this helpful,,10,2

It's mostly getting used for email, web, word processing, playing some vintage games from GOG, and a little bit of light software development when I get an idea I want to test out over lunch.  It excels in all these use cases.One thing you'll want to take note of when buying one of these is that the RAM is soldered onto the motherboard.  So you cannot upgrade RAM after purchase.  The SSD however appears to be an m.2 that can be upgraded.  In order to do so you'll need to remove all the screws on the base and carefully peel the bottom panel off.  Then find the m.2 wrapped in a protective sleeve in the one corner.  Acer appears to have a website that lists compatible m.2 modules.The power supply is a small 65 watt affair and this laptop uses USB-C for power so you should have an easy time finding alternative power supplies in the future.It has a nice array of ports for connectivity.  HDMI for an external monitor, two thunderbolt, two USB-A ports, an audio jack, and an SD card reader built in.  Coming from a work laptop that is heavy on dongles I really appreciate not having to carry more dongles to use this.One feature that really is icing on the cake is the fingerprint reader built into the power button.  It was very easy to setup during the initial Windows setup process and I haven't had to enter my password or pin since.Windows did need to go through a number of updates upon first boot, and there's a small amount of bloatware pre-installed.  But, Windows does make it easy these days to remove bloatware.All in all I really like this little laptop.  It's light weight for easy carrying and snappy in terms of performance.  It really would make a good machine for students or for anyone who needs to have a computer on the go.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bobmon,6 people found this helpful,,10,2
B0BTQWR77M,Laptop-1920x1200-Display-i7-1355U-SFG14-71T-72QV,"Powerful, portable and visually stunning laptop","Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2023","I recently had the chance to work with the Acer Swift Go 14 laptop, and it has quickly become my go-to device for both work and play. As an Intel Evo verified notebook, it offers superior performance, faster Wi-Fi, and a long-lasting battery that charges quickly. It has truly provided me with an amazing laptop experience. Is it a desktop killer? No. But it is fantastic for computing on the go in an incredibly portable form factor.Multitasking is totally possible with the Acer Swift Go, thanks to its powerful 13th Gen Intel Core i7-1355U processor and dedicated Intel Iris Xe graphics. Announced in earlly 2023, he Intel Core i7-1355U is a high-end mobile CPU that is based on the Alder Lake architecture. So this laptop puts you on the bleeding edge when it comes to processing chops. Whether I'm working on a teaching presentation, streaming my favorite videos, or playing games, this laptop consistently delivers outstanding performance.One of my favorite features of the Swift Go is its 14"" 1920 x 1200 IPS display. The screen offers great color accuracy, deep blacks, and ultra-crisp image quality. Plus, the touchscreen capabilities allow me to easily tap and swipe my way through tasks, making it even more enjoyable to use.The internal specifications of the Acer Swift Go are equally impressive. With 16GB of onboard LPDDR5 memory and a 512GB PCIe Gen 4 SSD, I have a reasonable amount of storage and enough memory for most applications.Security is a priority for me, especially on a laptop away from home. The Swift Go's power button with a built-in fingerprint reader offers both computer protection and Windows Hello Certification. This helps to keep my laptop secure without compromising on convenience.The Swift Go is sleek and lightweight, weighing in at just 0.59"" thin and 2.76 pounds. The high-end aluminum body easily fits into my bag. The eco-conscious OceanGlass touchpad is a thoughtful addition, aligning with my environmentally friendly values. If you haven't heard of OceanGlass, it's a touchpad that is surfaced with a sleek, glass-like texture and is made from ocean-bound plastic waste. It is eco-friendly because it helps reduce plastic pollution in the ocean by using recycled plastic waste.The Acer Swift Go's 1440p QHD camera is perfect for video calls. The TNR (Temporal Noise Reduction) technology ensures high-quality imagery even in low-light conditions, while Acer PurifiedVoice with AI Noise Reduction keeps my audio crystal clear.The Acer Swift Go 14 has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, design, and features. It's an excellent choice for anyone seeking a powerful, portable, and visually stunning laptop that can handle a wide range of tasks with ease.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Art,7 people found this helpful,,10,2
B0BTQWR77M,Laptop-1920x1200-Display-i7-1355U-SFG14-71T-72QV,impressive performance and quality,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2023","I've been AMD fan for a very long time, but this Intel Evo just surprise me.This laptop comes just as it should, 16G of RAM (8 is not enough), plenty of space in a very fast drive, the power button fingerprint reader is fast and reliable. Touch screen is responsive, screen in bright enough, and the 16:10 format gives more space and it's better for productivity.Touchpad is on point and clicky. 1440p (2K) camera when most devices comes with 720p. Backlit keyboard for the night shift. Audio DTS, loud and clear. And plenty of connectivity options. I would have preferred a full SD instead of a microSD, since I usually shoot with a pro mirrorless. The HDMI 2.1 allows to output 8K or 4K 120Hz witch for a gamer or home theater enthusiast is a nice plus.Its also nice the full chassis is Aluminum alloy, very sturdy and light t the same time.Now what actually surprise me, the APU (that is how AMD call its CPU+GPU processors).This comes with the latest top Intel Evo APU, the Core™ i7-1365U, announced just in Q1 of this year, so the best and newer of the ultra portable, including the best Intel integrated GPU, Intel® Iris® Xe with 96 units.Well this setup is able to run Hogwarts Legacy on par with my 2021 Gaming laptop witch comes with a GTX 1650M with 4Gb of GDDR6, and looks better IMO.If you are looking for a very portable laptop, that will allow you to play most games, including the latest and brightest, in low to medium quality, look no further, this integrated Intel GPU does the trick nicely.So far I have no negatives or complains about this laptop. Support has been nice from Acer, drivers are updating well and without issues so far. It becomes my default laptop.Almost forget, in best performance mode, the battery last about 6 hours, with display brightness at maximum, so with the recommended power configuration, probably will be able to get 10 to 12 hours. Playing a AAA game, I was able to get about 3 hours and still some power left, comparing with my gaming laptop that gets less than an hour gaming in battery and will not allow to set full performance, this one is the MVP.SO VERY RECOMENDED... you will not regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,ludohavil,9 people found this helpful,,10,2
B0BTQWR77M,Laptop-1920x1200-Display-i7-1355U-SFG14-71T-72QV,Good slim performer on a budget,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2023","I use computers for various things.  I have a desktop PC for all the gaming and really beefy computational stuff, don't do quite as much of this on a laptop.  With 16 GB of RAM and a 512GB hard drive, this is ready for most needs.  This kind of laptop is the perfect fit for occasional gaming and miscellaneous projects.I ran some quick benchmarks on it, and everything seems to be performing at or above specs.  The NVMe drive is responsive, Windows 11 boots quickly, and the touch screen is a nice bonus.  It uses a USB-C style charger which will take up one of the two USB-C ports, and there are still two USB-A ports as well, so you can get around and do your thing without hauling a port expander or USB hub around.  It does not have on-board Ethernet, which is a little bit of a bummer, but easily fixed with an external device.I really like the fingerprint sensor for Windows Hello login.  It's conveniently integrated into the power button.  I don't care for the function key behavior.  By default it's configured for the top row to act as media keys, and you have to hold down the Fn modifier key to get them to work as traditional F1-F12 keys.  Most other brands do this and include some sort of key combination that swaps the behavior to be traditional by default and media keys with the modifier, which is especially handy if you occasionally use some apps that have a lot of function key shortcuts.  The only way to toggle on this machine is from the BIOS/UEFI configuration screen, so there is no quick toggling back and forth.I'm also not a huge fan of the half-sized up and down cursor keys.  This is a space saving measure, but it makes gaming a little awkward.  Also, they combined the Page Up/Down buttons with these so you have to use the function overlay key and tiny keys at the same time.  A common keystroke in apps like Excel and Chrome is Control+PageUp/Down to switch tabs, so this requires a bit of contortion - I ended up using Control+Tab and Control+Shift+Tab instead.  Likewise, the home and end keys are overlayed onto the left and right cursor keys, so if you're selecting large blocks of text from the keyboard, a shortcut like Control+Shift+End becomes the 4-fingered Control+Shift+Fn+Right.  Of course, if you use an external keyboard with more buttons, you can bypass most of this.  Overall, the keyboard does have a good feel, even if it is using some space-saving key removal.  I'm not knocking the score for this, as it's pretty typical with other brands in this size as well, but you should be aware.The case included in the bundle is a minimal zippered slip cover, and doesn't have any handle or strap.  It's suitable for slipping into a book bag or hand-carrying short distances.  There didn't seem to be much bloatware on the machine.  There were a couple of one-time offers for McAfee, Office 365, and Xbox subscriptions, but nothing too egregious.The fans seem to run at a reasonable speed and don't make much noise.  The speakers are honest-to-goodness stereo, and there's a ""dts"" logo on the case, so I guess there's some spacial sound trickery going on to make it sound better.  I haven't tried exploring this further or adjusting it, but it sounds good and most people would probably want to keep that on unless they're doing precision audio work in which case they would probably be using better headphones or speakers anyway.The built-in camera looks pretty sharp, but it doesn't appear to support Windows Hello facial recognition.  Still, it's just fine for Zoom calls and such.All in all, this seems to be a lot of laptop for the money, focusing on the features that people use the most.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Daily review,12 people found this helpful,,10,2
B0BTQWR77M,Laptop-1920x1200-Display-i7-1355U-SFG14-71T-72QV,Always have a better experience with an Acer laptop over the others,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2023","GENERAL USESeems speedy at this point, but you may want to uninstall some or all of the promo bloatware that comes bundled. A lot of it is unnecessary for my uses. Intel processor is great. I have a similar-range Dell laptop with an AMD, and it runs so hot that the fans go all the time. The Intel in this Acer is so much better; runs at normal heat levels that the fans aren't always working against.SCREENColors are fantastic and contrast crisply. The laptop also has a pretty great viewing angle.TRACKPAD, KEYBOARD, & TOUCH SCREENKeyboard feels standard but comfortable. Nice to see the fingerprint reader is coupled with the power button since occasionally it isn't in other laptops. My one complaint is there is no alternative numpad accessible via a function key. Laptops seem to be phasing this concept out, but it basically means anyone on a laptop can't access ALT code functions without using the virtual keyboard or a power user key replacement tool. Sort of a niche complaint, but I have it.I've had two (now three) Acer laptops over the years, and all have had excellent trackpads; genuinely, they seem much better than the competition's. This one's no exception. Smooth to touch, very responsive. Touch screen is also good and responsive. However, I dislike the hinge for turning the laptop into a tablet. It has central connecting pieces the two sides of the laptop work around, as opposed to a true and more seamless fold. When you open the laptop, this means it elevates slightly as the screen works around this hinge. As a result, it acts like a tiny stand and angles the keyboard. This isn't just an Acer thing; other laptops with touch screens are doing their hinges this way, too. Personally, I dislike it and find it annoying when using a lap desk, as it encourages the laptop to slide forward or not sit flush against a lap desk's guard, if you have one that has a guard.SOUNDThe sound in this laptop is surprisingly good. Its bass is about as good as you can expect from a laptop, in my opinion, and plugging in wired earbuds/headphones is also seamless. I've had a Dell laptop that had interference/noise from fans come through the earbud connection. This Acer doesn't have that issue at all. Everything sounds great.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A.

B0BTQWR77M,Laptop-1920x1200-Display-i7-1355U-SFG14-71T-72QV,Great overall laptop - good performance,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2023","I was provided this laptop to review and found this to be a very good laptop, fast wi-fi, good battery length, and overall good performance.I decided to take this with my on a recent work journey to use as my personal device and watched some high quality movies on the flight. Also upgraded this to the pro version as I need remote desktop capabilities and had no issues with the upgrade. I have been running the Microsoft Office Suite as well as Adobe Creative Cloud apps such as Photoshop and Audition, all performing very nicely.The power block is fairly large on this so you do need good space in your power strip, or use a small extension cord as I do so it fits in more spaces. There is no ethernet adapter, only wi-fi. As mentioned, the wi-fi is very good and fast however I like my devices wired so I popped on an ethernet adapter and connected straight away.I also connected my Xbox wireless headphones and did some gaming. No, it doesn't run Flight Simulator too well but everything else seemed to work just fine.I really like the integrated fingerprint scanner, it's built-in to the power button. For such a small receptor, I have found it to be very accurate and quick to sign in. I like using local accounts and had no problems with authentication.I'm also very impressed with the 12 core design, gives it a good amount of power to go through tasks and the touchscreen is very responsive as well.I like this laptop a lot, it's very light and functional. I think it is thinner than some tablets that I have seen and here you get a whole Windows desktop. Definitely recommend this device.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Doctor,One person found this helpful,,10,2

I love that it came with a laptop sleeve (it's the little thoughtful things, you know).But I didn't like that I couldn't use the computer, until I had a Microsoft ID or a Skype ID. On the one hand, I like that this sort of electronic paper-trail can make people think before they do nefarious things online, because they can be easily tracked, but I also don't like how much access Acer/Microsoft want into my life, in order for me to use their products. The setup process actually felt kind of invasive, all the tracking and them asking for access to different accounts, my fingerprint, etc. I guess if you don't care (b/c that info is mostly readily available anyway, through different means) it's fine. You also have to have an internet connection to set the computer up.After the long setup process (its not open and go, like a Mac), the computer was ready to go. It's easy to navigate. Easy to use.Oh, we couldn't get the fingerprint function to work.I'll update this review if anything comes up, but overall, a nice little laptop.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Unicorn Reviews,One person found this helpful,,10,2

B099FM5CMR,Dell-Chromebook-Laptop-Computer-Renewed,Arrived Damaged & Out Of Date,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2023","This one is going back! I needed an inexpensive Chromebook for a Ham Radio project and I like Dell so this seemed like a good deal. It is a low end Chromebook so I expected it to be slow and have low storage capacity. Both of those are true and I was willing to work around them. I normally steer clear of ""refurbished"" equipment unless I am very familiar with the seller but I took a chance on this one.What I didn't expect is that it would arrived damaged. Please look at the photos. At one point it had been dropped hard on the right rear corner so who knows what other internal damage still exists. (That's why I got the extended warranty.) It was shipped in bubble wrap in a plastic envelope so I don't know if the damage occurred during shipment or if it was sent that way. The box I sent it back it offers VASTLY more protection than the envelope the seller shipped it in.But it still worked so I was willing to live with it until I attempted to install some Android software from the Google Play Store. I can't! Seems this laptop is so out of date that it hasn't been eligible for updates since September 2021. As a result I cannot load anything from the play store and almost two years of security and system updates cannot be loaded. I didn't see anything in the description that warned about this so I am returning the laptop for a refund.The description reads ""This product is in ""Excellent condition"". The screen and body show no signs of cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches away.""  Look at the photos: you can see that damage from 12 FEET away. And, naturally, I have to pay return postage which will be about half what I paid for it.Beware when you see a computer ""deal"" on Amazon that features a ""renewed"" product unless security and functionality is unimportant to you. This seller, ""Tech Magnet"" is now on my permanent ""NEVER AGAIN"" list of sellers on Amazon.",1.0 out of 5 stars,JMAC,23 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2
B099FM5CMR,Dell-Chromebook-Laptop-Computer-Renewed,Affordable Option if you need something temporary...,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2023","For the most part, the computer software is well refurbished as new. Fully functional, battery life is great, screen quality and clarity are absolutely exceptional. Is a touch screen but I believe some people didn't receive one that was. Does come with a charger and packaged well for protection. Mine did come with some minor external defects (such as a few minor scratches, very small cracks, etc...) but nothing a little case can't hide. Connects well with any wifi, runs exceptionally well, already has some Google software installed (Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc...), Only minor issue that wasn't a full 5 stars for me was the Camera quality. I troubleshot via a Zoom meeting and the camera quality was absolutely dreadful but I don't often have video meetings which is good. But again for the overall price point, this is definitely a steal in my opinion.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Amore,28 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

Turns out, it is! I was very surprised by how great the build quality is for a cheap laptop. Even though it is plastic, it's a smooth, hard plastic, and the hinges are very strong. The screen is amazing, bright with good colors. For basic tasks like browsing, documents, play store games, streaming platforms, and listening to music, it is very fast and snappy. We haven't tried more demanding tasks yet, but we'll see. The battery life is decent so far. I'm very happy with this purchase; I got it on Black Friday, so I paid less than 200 dollars, and for that price, it's really worth it!P.S.: It's a little bit heavier than I expected, but it's fine for carrying it in a backpack.P.S.2: When it's updating, the base of the laptop gets very hot, so more demanding tasks might cause it to throttle a bit due to the heat.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sophia Arca Vertiz,28 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,Honest Review,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2023","I think this is the first review I have ever done lol So I bought this laptop after my Levono Yoga C90 finally went out. Going from a state of the art Laptop at the time (2018) and with an overall price tag of $1400.00, I could not see myself going back to anything else. (It had a dolby atmos soundbar built in lol) It had everything and more than I needed. And when I decided to buy something I could take on the go and do my day to day. I came about this laptop on Amazon. I needed something that would able to do what I mostly do on my laptop. Word processing and watching YouTube and the other streaming services I cant live without lol and check into other social media if I felt like it. I spent two days doing research, and looking at YouTube videos and reviews of this laptop. When I finally got it home, I was surprised how thin and light it was. I am a musician and I was surprised how clear and how loud the sound would get. Screen was very clear and bright. The one thing I had to get used to, is the operating system. I have used Windows for 30 plus years. I was surprised how easy it was to learn Chrome OS. There are MANY features I miss from Windows. But for what I need it to do its holding up . Overall for this price I am happy. NOTE: I have seen some reviewers say there is not a back lit keyboard. THERE IS ONE. I would NOT of bought this laptop if there was not one. Thats the first thing I look for. This laptop is like an electric hybrid, light simple to use and will get the job done. IF you are looking for a juiced up race car with all the bells and whistles, then this is not the right laptop for you. But if you wannt something affordable and does all the above, then this might be for you",5.0 out of 5 stars,Emire Galdamez,33 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2
B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,"Love It, But There are Some Trade Offs","Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2022","The backlit keyboard is the feature that caused me to choose this Chromebook, combined with a competitive price.  I've also had a positive experience with Acer products.This is a beautiful laptop!  But, it has only one USB-C port; if you're not willing to go wireless with mouse, printer, etc., you're SOL! (It's on the left side, too; if you're using wired mouse, and you're right handed, i's a pain!)  I regularly attach a USB drive, and so I would have liked an extra port; I got a wireless mouse to remedy the limitation.  (It does appear USBC ports are rapidly going the way of the 8-track, though.)The battery life is not as robust as expected; the de facto brightness is not bright enough, at least for my eyes, making it necessary to amp up brightness; that hurts battery life.  I took an 8-hour course where I was taking notes most of the day; I didn't bring my power cord, believing I had enough power; I barely made it!  That makes me skeptical enough not to leave the power cord at home next time; repowering takes minutes, though!  I also wonder if it's using up power even when off; sometimes, I'm surprised the power bar isn't at 100% after I've charged it and turned it off; this is an anecdotal observation.It's comfortable for typing, but heavy and unwieldy if you're trying to hold onto it while watching videos  lying in bed; but beautiful screen for watching stuff.Using it for what it's designed for; i.e., as a laptop, has been great.In sum, I'm satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others.",4.0 out of 5 stars,B'Davka,16 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

But when I opened the package, plugged it in, and tried to set it up nothing worked.  It showed the Chrome label then went immediately to the “connect to wifi” screen but it didn’t detect any networks.  Other devices are all connecting fine so the problem was with the new chromebook.  I called Acer and they ran me through a number of steps designed to power wash the unit or reset the battery but nothing worked.  They offered to fix it but they would have it for more than a week for shipping, repair, and return shipping.  I thought I could return it to Amazon for a replacement but it apparently comes from another reseller so I must return it for a refund and then buy a replacement.  Cumbersome but better than nothing.  At least Amazon is trustworthy with their returns.  Not sure if I should try again but the device looks and feels solid.

I replace them because I always seem to spill some kind of liquid in them which damages the circuits and makes the laptop less functional and reliable. This laptop has a touchscreen and is by far the best Chromebook that I have ever owned. Be advised that this Chromebook states that there is a backlit keyboard but it does not. I reached out to Amazon support to swap it out for the correct model with backlit keyboard and they just sent me the exact same model back without the backlit keyboard.

B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,Not as good as my last Chromebook in this price range,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2023","Pros:- Extremely lightweight- Comfortable keyboard- Minimal bezel around the screen- Connects easily to bluetooth mouse- Has ""classic"" USB port plus USB-c portsCons- Screen is very green-toned. Like if you hold up a piece of white paper next to it or compare to other screens, it has a strong green cast. I would expect something better and more neutral in this price range, since I haven't run into this issue on other chromebooks.- It has struggled to load or handle 10 tabs with music or a video playing. Again, in this price range, I've had chromebooks that don't stumble on that right out of the box.- The webcam is total garbage, grainy and very darkI haven't used it heavily enough to evaluate battery yet.I'll probably keep it because Amazon fights you more on returning electronics, but the greenishness of the screen is a huge bummer.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Michelle,8 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

Though it does have USB-A so you could use even an old SD adapter.- The maximum volume is not particularly loud. If you want to listen to this while doing an activity that's at all noisy (cooking, car repair) you may find yourself needing bluetooth headphones.- The speakers are on the bottom, which means if you set it on a muffling surface (your lap, a bed) it'll make the above problem even worse.- The screen dimness cannot be reduced very far. When used at night in the dark, the dimmest setting is still pretty bright (Night Light is little help, as it changes color temperature, not dimness).Without these minor disappointments it would be a slam dunk of a computer.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Andrew,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

Longer than my HP laptop anyway. I can probably get used to that, though. Also, I think the speakers are fine. I don't expect any laptop speakers to blow me away and think these are adequate.

B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,Expensive Lightweight and Portable Chromebook- Beautiful Touchscreen,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2021","I want to start off by saying this is my first experience with the ChromeOS.  I have used iOS and Windows extensively- but have wanted to give ChromeOS a try to see how it measured up.  There was a slight learning curve, but once I got up and running it was pretty easy to figure out.  I have been using the Chromebook for a few weeks now for light work that is web-based and playing some lower end games via apps and have found both positive and negative points.The positives:- The touchscreen functionality works well and is a great asset to have both for work and games.  The touchscreen is responsive and feels sturdy.- This Acer Chromebook is lightweight and very portable while still having a large enough screen for easy visualization with the 13"" screen.- The battery life is exceptional- I have used it off and on for over a full day without having to charge the battery.-  The optional slot for a SIM card is a great feature so that the Chromebook can be used on the 4G LTE network.-  The screen has very good resolution with sharp rich colors in 1080 HD. It is a great option for streaming movies on the go.-  A decent amount of memory at 8GB is included.- Can be used with Chrome Enterprise if using for business/academic purposes for ease of management.-  Powers up quickly with the SSD and is ready to go in seconds.- Keyboard is backlit- which I feel is a must have when using a laptop in a lower light environment.- 2 USB C ports and 1 USB-A port along with a 3.5 mm headphones jack are included.The negatives:-  The flash storage is small compared to other similar sized laptops- at 128 GB this is more akin to a tablet or phone.- Keyboard it smaller and does not have a separate number pad.-  There is no SD slot for adding memory.-  ChromeOS does have a slight learning curve for a new user.-  I noticed somewhat frequent app crashes when I was playing games, especially when waking from hibernation with the lid closed.  I had to force close the app using the Ctrl+W several times and found the alert that ChromeOS had restarted unexpectedly after an error.  There were also some instances where opening multiple tabs in the web browser caused the OS to freeze.- Priced somewhat high compared to other similar laptops.Overall, this  Chromebook is a nice product for light use.  It has a beautiful touchscreen display and long battery life while being light weight and small enough to fit in most bags/purses/carry on easily.  It has enough memory and storage with the SSD to make it an attractive option for travel or use at school/work when not needing any higher end computing functions.  I really like the ability to add the SIM card for cellular network access- making it truly portable.  While it is somewhat pricey, depending on your needs, each individual needs to do comparison shopping with similar windows/Mac products to see what fits best.While I did notice some issues with the Chrome OS- while they are annoying, as of this point they were not enough for me to give it a negative review as I didn't lose any data and the Chromebook restarts very quickly.  I will update if anything changes.  This Chromebook is definitely worth looking at to see if it meets your needs.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Sixtus,2 people found this helpful,,7,2

B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,Premium Chromebook,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2021","As I sit here typing away on this little Chromebook, I reflect that Acer and netbooks-now-Chromebooks have come a long way.  Back in the early 90s, I got my first PC, and it was an Acer.  At that time, it was a no-name brand that was simply cheap.  Today, Acer is a household name, and Chromebooks one of its specialties.  Chromebooks, the love child of early tablets and low powered netbooks, has also taken off. For light duty computing, they’re hard to ignore in terms of size and price.  It’s no wonder that schools use them, being small, light, cheap to replace, and easy to manage.  This one here has gone corporate, which is a new one to me.  Does it really have a place in the business world, particularly at a price point equal to that of a light laptop?  Maybe.  With the whole Office suite available online, rather than needing a PC install, this could work.  Of course, there are all the Google equivalents of the Office apps, but there are still some compatibility issues between the two that can be a pain to deal with.  But let's look at how this little machine does.First off, the performance is really good.  Compared to the school Chromebooks that are hanging around the house, this is a race horse compared to draft horses.  Multitasking is no problem, nor the 20 some odd Chromebook tabs I tend to have open.  Scrolling through docs, webpages, and menus is lickity split quick.  Video playback is smooth, both on and off the web,  Sound….well….it’s there.  It exists, it works, but nothing to write home about.  Ditto for the webcam.  Using the camera for document scanning is not something that I’d suggest with this model, unless you are hooking up an external camera, See the attached images for an idea of what that looks like.  The screen is quite nice visually, though the touch can be a bit unresponsive.  I found this tended to be in the corners, and not constant.  The touchpad is quite responsive, and took me some getting used to (I detest touchpads, opting for a wireless mouse whenever possible).  The battery life is, well, pretty awesome.  In the month I’ve spent using this on and off (a few hours here, a few hours there), I think I’ve charged it up four times.  There are unused tablets around my house that require charging more frequently.Overall, this is a very nice Chromebook.  Is it worth the 600-800 asking price?  Personally, I couldn’t say yes to that.  It’s like asking if a Civic is worth forty grand.  Sure, it’s really nice, but it’s still a Chromebook, with all the limitations that implies.5 stars - Excellent/Perfect - This is the stuff right here, folks!  Rare gem.4 stars - Good/Great - Has a lot going for it, even if not perfect3 stars - Ok - Not bad, but doesn’t have anything particularly special about it2 stars - Not so good - More cons than pros on this little number1 star - Don’t walk, run away - No redeeming qualities",4.0 out of 5 stars,C.

B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,Even a top of the line Chromebook is still a Chromebook,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2022","Acer Chromebook Enterprise Spin 513: $736.93 at the time of reviewI’m going to be honest, I didn’t *need* a Chromebook when I ordered this. I have a personal laptop and a work laptop so I wasn’t in the market for another. However, I work in a company that uses Google Enterprise and I’ve been thinking about testing a Chromebook in that capacity for a long time. So when the opportunity popped up right in front of my face I had to take it.*What I liked*:The very first thing you’ll notice about this laptop (before even turning it on) is that it’s very light. But it still manages to feel solid when closed thanks to the aluminum lid. This is actually pretty important as the screen is so thin that I don’t think a plastic top would protect it well enough.The next thing that stands out (and is, in fact, outstanding) is the beautiful IPS 1080p display. It is crisp with vibrant colors and at 13.3” the pixel density is excellent (at about 165 PPI). This means that things will look sharp.I also like that the display is touchscreen (with the ability to flip the screen over flat to enable a kind of tablet mode)The performance is also great for Chromebook. With 8GB of RAM and a decent Qualcomm Snapdragon processor driving it, it can handle just about anything that Chrome OS can throw at it.It’s also worth noting that it is outfitted with 2 USB-C 3.2 ports for charging, data, and accessories. And it is very well-equipped on the wireless front too with Wireless AC as well as Bluetooth 5.0.*What I didn't like*:Unfortunately for all of the places that this Chromebook accels, it seems to have a corresponding weakness, starting with the case. While the aluminum lid is nice and provides good stability when closed, the bottom of the case is all plastic and suffers from pretty bad top case & keyboard flex.The screen, while gorgeous, caps out at a maximum brightness that suffers in full daylight. If you’re using this outside in sunlight, you may have problems reading things.I won’t rag on the performance, as it is quite good. However, I will say that I felt limited by ChromeOS in this regard. What good is a Mustang if they only let you drive 25Mph? The programs I did use were snappy, but good luck finding something that will actually test the guts of this thing.*Things you Should Know:*As I mentioned above, I ordered this Chromebook to test it as a business use case. My organization uses Google Workspace as it’s primary collaboration and productivity suite. I was hoping to identify a cost effective alternative to more expensive laptops that I could start deploying to my user base.I found this laptop to be a very suitable option for business-class computing. If that’s your goal, then you could do a lot worse than this, especially considering that it is Enterprise-ready.*The Bottom Line:*As a laptop for general use and computing, this Chromebook from Acer isn’t half bad. However, the compromises in build quality are unacceptable at this price point. There are *much* better options (both business and consumer-grade) for nearly $750. I hemmed and hawed over where to land on the ole star scale. In the end, because this is targeted at business user and in the sector, $750 is a somewhat reasonable price for a laptop, I settled on four stars out of five. But if you’re a regular old consumer, your $750 will buy you a much better laptop right here on Amazon. I would not order this over again knowing what I know now.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nick E,2 people found this helpful,,8,2
B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,"If you're into ChromeOS, here's a Rolls Royce","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2021","My old Windows laptops are nearing the end of their lifecycles. I didn't think a Chromebook would meet my needs, since most of them seem relatively underpowered. But I figured I'd give this high-end model a shot.This is easily the most portable laptop I've ever owned. It's the size and thickness of a paper notebook,and nearly as lightweight. Despite this, the keyboard (which is backlit!) is essentially full-sized, andfeels great under the fingers.The 13"" screen offers full HD (1920 x 1080) native resolution, which is both a blessing (when watching movies and/or using multiple apps) and a curse (when trying to read text, which can be a challenge at this size/scale). Luckily, the virtual dimensions of the display are easily upscaled, and the quality of the upscaled image is outstanding, unlike many Windows devices, which become noticeably pixelated. The touchscreen works as expected, though I almost always use a mouse.Aside from a 1/8"" stereo headphone jack, there are only three ports: a pair of USC-C 3.2 Gen 1s whichboth support charging/power delivery and/or DisplayPort output, and a single USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 port. This arrangement may be adequate for many users, but if you use multiple peripherals like I do, you'll probably want to obtain a USB-C hub, preferably one that supports power delivery. The DesertWesthub I use gives me three USB-A ports, an HDMI output, an Ethernet jack and slots for several different types of memory cards. All of the ports work flawlessly with the Chromebook, including the HDMI, whichlets me connect the laptop to almost any external monitor or HDTV.Added bonus: You can connect a SIM card and run the laptop off 4G cellphone towers. Very handy for frequent travelers.I typically use a laptop as the control center for HD music listening. My library resides on an external4TB HDD, and my playback rig is a Schiit Modi 3 DAC driving a Magni 2 headphone amp. I'm happy to report that this Chromebook drives my setup with no issues at all when I plug the Modi directly into the USB-A port. (It would probably work through a USB-C hub as well, though I haven't tried it.) Both of my preferred audio apps (Neutron and Foobar2000) are available on the Chrome store and operate as expected.Hard to fault the performance. This Acer powers up in seconds, connects to every wireless device I've tried effortlessly, and runs off a fully-charged battery for the better part of a day. Web browsing with Chrome is as brisk as my most powerful desktops. Web-based apps like Zoom, Slack and VS Code are also highly responsive, and so are the handful of apps I've downloaded from the Chrome store.The 128GB onboard memory is skimpy by Windows standards. There's no built-in memory card slot (an odd and annoying omission that cost my review 1 star), but it's easily and cheaply expandable via the slots available on most USB-C hubs. A 128 GB MicroSD card will double this laptop's capacity for less than $20.The biggest issue with this unit is its price. At nearly $800, it's competing with a number of Windows 10/11 laptops with similar specifications/feature sets. But if you're accustomed to the ChromeOS ecosystem, or just want a zippy laptop/tablet that's ultra-portable and stupid-easy to use, this high-end Acer is worth serious consideration.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Ludix,8 people found this helpful,,8,2

B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,"Adequate performance, good battery life, supports LTE, comparatively expensive","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2021","When Google first envisioned computers based on ChromeOS, Chromebooks, they were to be a lightweight, inexpensive, relatively unhackable alternative to those based on Windows, but far more user friendly than those based on Linux (though Linux remains at the core of ChromeOS, so it's really an interfacial skin on Linux).This focus led to the first generation of ChromeOS devices, which were universally low-powered and mostly with fairly cheap components. But through the years, Google has improved ChromeOS to increase functionality, and, in more recent years, to support access to the Linux kernel to lure hardcore computer programmers to the platform.As a result, alongside very cheap low-grade Chromebooks that just barely get by with dismal screens and nominal processing power and memory, you have newer, considerably more expensive variants that offer beefed-up performance, better screens, better keyboards, etc. Some of these can cost North of $1000, in comparison to entry-level machines that are often available for under $200.This particular Chromebook clocks in near the top of that price range, and so you'd expect it to be promising top line preformance and components. The reality is that you get some nice features and hardware, but, ultimately, the price is high relative to the full package.The justification for the high price is the inclusion of a 4G LTE modem. This means you can insert an LTE data SIM from your phone provider to be connected without having to worry about a WiFi signal. If you don't need this capability, then there are PLENTY of alternate Chromebooks with similar specs--some from Acer, but also from other name brands--that cost roughly half of what this one does.The 1920x1080 LED/TFT touchscreen is quite nice: Vibrant, bright, accurate, and the kind of screen you'd expect on a Chromebook at this price point. While the chicklet-type keyboard is nothing special, it's certainly comfortable to use. And you get 8Gb of memory. All fine.But for some reason, Acer has chosen to go with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c processor. This is two-year-old technology that is sufficient for simple stuff like Web surfing but starts to choke on more demanding tasks. There are plenty of mid/high end Chromebooks powered by Intel processors that do a better job with compute-hungry applicaitons, while maintaining good battery life. Acer even makes a number of these. So I can't quite understand why they went with the 7c in this relatively expensive package.Connecting using a SIM card is trivial: Merely insert it in the tray, and the Chromebook recognizes it, and you're set up and connected in less than a minute. I got pretty good speeds using my AT&T SIM, getting nearly 60 MB/s down. If you have both a SIM installed and WiFi access, the Chromebook will automatically prioritize WiFi with the LTE as a backup.A device like this is often used for media consumption (watching streaming videos, for example). So the quality of the built-in speakers makes a difference. And the speakers here are poor: Thin sounding and not very loud. It doesn't help that they fire downward with the laptop in standard (keyboard in front of you) position. In fliptop mode (make a ""tee pee"" with the laptop for viewing, with the keyboard behind the monitor), the speakers sound a bit better. But they are still lousy for a Chreomebook at this price point.A summary of pros and cons:Pros:** Supports 4G SIM card connections** 8Gb of memory** Very light and portable** Good screen: Vibrant and bright** Touchscreen** Decent battery life (9-10 hours on a full charge)** Standard USB-C charging port** Free Chrome Enterprise upgrade included (personal users won't find this very useful)Cons** Uses outdated and underpowered Qualcomm Snapdragon 7C processor** Mediocre low cost eMMC storage** Limited interaction ports (2x USB-C, 1x USB-A, headphone jack). USB ports only support USB 3.2 r1 (5 MB/s)** No SmartMedia slot** Integrated webcam is low resolution (1280x720) and not very bright** Integrated speakers are poorOn the whole, the only real selling point for this Chromebook at the given price is the LTE modem. if you want a Chromebook that supports that functionality, you don't have a huge number of options, and this is a reasonable one. But if you won't be using that, then there are plenty of better options for Chromebooks with Intel processors, good battery life, and a lower list price.",4.0 out of 5 stars,David Pearlman,2 people found this helpful,,8,2
B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,Nice Choice in a Chromebook,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2021","I’ve always been a ‘PC Guy’.  But I’ve seen a lot of advertisements lately about the advantages of using a Chromebook instead.  So I figured it was high time to give one a try.After a bit of searching and comparing models, I decided to purchase the Acer Enterprise Spin 513.  I did so for a few reasons.  Firstly, Acer is a brand that I recognize.  A lot of the Chromebook books I saw were off-brands, so I was unsure of what I’d be get.  Acer I knew I could trust.Secondly, this Acer Spun 513 is a touch screen laptop.  I actually didn’t know how much I would use the touch feature…I hardly ever use it on my Windows laptop….but I figured it was better to have it than not.  Besides, I didn’t know how using a touchpad on a Chromebook would be, so it was a bit of ‘added security’ for me.Third, this Acer Spun 513 was one of the few Chromebooks I saw that featured a backlit keyboard.  That is something I won’t go without.  It makes it do much easier to use any laptop…or even desktop for that fact.  That was probably the major selling point for me on this unit.Setup on the Acer Spin 513 was a breeze.  All I had to do was connect it to my wifi and put in my Google account credentials, and I was ready to go.  There was so much less drama in the whole process than setup a Windows computer.This Chromebook provides you with an upgrade to the ‘Enterprise’ edition if you want,  i was unsure of what the ‘enterprise edition’ actually was, so I opted out of it during setup.  I discovered later it was more geared for users who work from home and includes a lot of added security features among other things.  I’ll maybe go back and set my Google account up as an Enterprise one…if I still can.My opinion is that it’s just an Android phone in a laptop body.  So, if you’re an Android user this thing should be a piece of cake to navigate.  The Google Play Store is there as are a lot of the apps you find on an Android phone.  Being an Apple guy, it took a bit for me to get used to it.  But one I did, things were great.The Acer Spin 513 Chromebook seems to be a very capable machine.  It’s fast and doesn’t drag in the least.  The touchscreen is a little quirky, but maybe it’s just me.  It will probably take some practice getting used to as I’m used to a substantially larger screen than this 13” model.  The colors on the screen are bright and clear, and the resolution is amazing.  Videos look so good on this machine.The Spin 513 Chromebook comes with 8 gb of ram and a 128gb SSD installed which is definitely enough power to run most of the apps you can install.  You can upgrade the memory by adding a card.  You’ll need that if you want to store a lot of pics or videos.The Acer Spin 513 charges via one of the two USB C ports.  There is one each side which makes it convenient to keep the power cord out of the way.  And the battery does last a long time.  I ran it all day without a hitch.There is also a USB 3.2 port on the Acer Spin 513 Chromebook as well as a ‘Display Port over USB C’ to add a second monitor if you wish.  USC is becoming very common on laptops these days.One other neat feature on the Spin 513 is the built-in 4G.  Just like with an Android phone, if you don’t have wifi, the Chromebook will switch over to using cellular data.  If a nice feature if you’re on the go a lot.  But rem, it does cost for the service.All-in-all, I think the Acer Spin 513 is a very nice Chromebook.  It has a lot of useful features and performed well for the everyday tasks Zi put it through.  And it also wasn’t to awkward using it in the tablet configuration.  And it’s capable enough to use in a business environment.  It’s a little pricey, but I recommend it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Tbone,3 people found this helpful,,8,2

B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,Smooth performance,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2021","This latest Chromebook spin is thin and lightweight. Weighting only 1.2 Kg. It can be used as both, a standard laptop, or you can spin it into a semi tablet design utilizing its hinge. You can flip the screen for 360-degrees but, you can’t detach the keyboard and touchpad.Performance wise, the Octa-core Snapdragon 7c CPU and 8 GB RAM now standard in this newer model as well as the SSD storage capacity allowed for multitasking with relative ease and speed for everyday work.The Octa-core Snapdragon 7c is almost 4 generations behind the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 5G.Also,  Snapdragon by Qualcomm provides better battery performance vs Intel processors in my opinion.The display resolution is Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) with touchscreen. The Resolution is great for a 13.3” display. Screen type is LCD with LED backlight technology. When tested outdoors, the screen had good viewing angles, good colors and relatively good brightness utilizing the power of its IPS panel. However, it appeared dim with strong daylight.The presence of a SIM slot allowed for using the laptop on the go with relative ease utilizing its up-to-4G powered networks.The 4670 mAh battery capacity allows for efficient use for a full working day of heavy use with the screen on relatively high brightness levels, which is a positive point.Some of the points in my opinion to support this high price, is that this being an enterprise version meaning: it has a faster processor for work needs, a fast SSD hard drive, an 8GB RAM, Free Chrome enterprise package. The free Chrome enterprise package is good for companies whose IT department can log in easily to employees' chromebooks and perform necessary IT tasks. This may not be a very useful point for normal users.In summary, this Chromebook gave a minimalistic, easy and very fast experience. I myself nearly live my life on the web. So, for basic/medium daily computing and online work, this Chromebook can be sufficient.The price it self is justifiable for normal users who love chromebooks (Except for the price premium added for Chrome Enterprise), as it has a light operating system that can be faster than many expensive smart phones when using similar mobile apps but with a much bigger screen.So it's really more about comparing this to advanced and expensive smart phones who can easily achieve $800+ to give a fair comparison rather than just comparing this to heavy duty laptopsOptions and features to consider in the future? I would recommend higher storage capacity in the future. I would also recommend a detachable keyboard and touchpad as well as higher screen resolution and brightness for greater sharpness and better overall experience.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Elazab,One person found this helpful,,8,2
B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,"A good Chromebook, but for the price better devices are available.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2021","When I think of Chromebooks, I usually  think of  a system for kids or a person that could do all required daily tasks on the Web.Using the Acer Chromebook Enterprise Spin 513 for several days have not improved my perspective about Chromebooks.Even though Chromebooks have come a long way, since they were introduced, still much more can be done with a laptop running Windows, MacOS, and even a Linux distro. Chromebooks could run apps such as Microsoft Office, but the mobile app version does not offer all features available on a laptop.Still some apps cannot run on a wide screen and they default to running on the center of the Chromebook.The Acer Chromebook Enterprise Spin 513 is made of aluminum, which allows a light and thin construction and it is quite portable at 2.8 pounds. It has 360 degree hinges and the bezels on left, right and top are reasonably small, with enough space to hold it as a tablet.This Acer Chromebook, has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c with LTE capabilities, in case you want to be always connected with a data plan.The Spin 513 has a good 1920 x 1080 crisp screen, bright enough for use outdoors...in the shade of course.The keyboard is backlit, and it is comfortable enough when typing and the touchpad is quite responsive with a smooth Gorilla Glass surface.What make Chromebooks appealing is the price, portability and long battery life. They could run productivity web apps as well as  Android apps from the Google Play store.The Acer Chromebook Enterprise Spin 513 battery could last a couple of days work without need to recharge. Even though the included AC to USB C charger is bulky, it could be charge with smaller chargers that can deliver the required power.The 720 Webcam is ok, as good as many other Chromebooks, and Windows laptops. It perform very well with video conferencing. The stereos speakers are very good for a thin laptop, but connecting pretty much any headphones (earbuds) will improve the sound quality.There is a 3.5mm combination audio jack that works with headsets, headphones or even a Mic, just in case you have wired devices or Bluetooth is not a choice.Acer Chromebook Enterprise Spin 513 has 2 USB Type-C 3.2 (Gen 1) ports that supports DisplayPort over USB-C and USB Charging.You could charge the Chromebook from either side and plugging an external display was a breeze. Just plug a display via a USB Type-C port and you could double the monitor real state. Depending of the external display it could also draw power from the Chromebook.It also has a USB 3.2 (Gen 1) Type-A port and a Nano SIM Slot. Besides those ports it also has Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Orientation, Game rotation vector sector and a Gravity sensor.This Acer Chromebook is very good for Google Classroom and it could work for students as well as teachers. I do think is overpriced at $800. There are many Chromebooks and tablets with similar performance and features that cost half the price. Even other units, from the same manufacturer, that perform better cost less.There are less expensive Windows laptops that could do everything this Acer Chromebook Enterprise Spin 513 can do. They could do it faster and could also perform other more demanding tasks that the Spin 513 can not perform. Also, it could have features the Enterprise Spin 513 lacks, such as WiFi 6 and SD card reader...and even be lighter.It could be that the addition of that LTE radio added to the price, since the ones without LTE cost a lot less. But LTE and even faster 5G could be added to pretty much any laptop via a USB dongle...if necessary.I have a high speed Internet service and this Chromebook can only reach half the download speed available. A similar price Windows laptop can reach 3x the download speed when connected to WiFi 6.By the way, the Acer Chromebook Enterprise Spin 513 arrived with a 3-year old Android version 9 (Pie). Some apps I used, were not compatible and since they require Android version 10 or newer.Also there isn't a hardware upgrade path, since all components are soldered to the mainboard.I ran several benchmarks and the scores were ok but lower than a less expensive 11"" inch 2-year old Android tablet I also use.",3.0 out of 5 stars,J.

B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,The only negative I have is the price tag...,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2021","So I work in IT and did a 1:1 deployment of Chromebooks 6-7 years ago when they were still a new thing and right after that deployment I left education and hadn't touched one since. I got this more for the house and for me and my wife to use in bed, but I decided to daily drive it for a week.My normal daily driver laptop is a Lenovo with a 5000 series ryzen and 16gb of ram. I wasn't expecting to use it much past emails and conference room meetings but it did well for most of the week. First in meetings, it was great had multiple tabs and added an outlook app that I could pin to the task bar. While at a lunch meeting I had a service issue and had to do a screen share and remotely control a computer so I quickly downloaded Webex and Splashtop (what we use) and my Webex call went well with no hiccups. Splashtop however is designed for a tablet setup and struggled some but worked well enough for me to get my work done on a remote server. All in all in a pinch it works but you must know its limitations.Now for what I'm actually going to use it for home use. For the home side having most of my work stuff setup on my login it will work well for any late-night calls and I won't have to leave the bed to get to my desktop or grab a laptop from the car. My wife used it for several hours shopping and it didn't get too hot sitting on top of a fleece blanket which was nice.Screen size is good and 1080p is perfect, the touch seems good, I'm an old mac user and still not a fan of touch screen laptops mostly due to smuges lol.Performance-wise its fine, 8gb of ram and a larger SSD is going to be required to try to justify the price point but the chassis is good but not perfect. Very minor deck flex but doesn't feel premium...Final thoughts:For the same price, I can go to BestBuy and get a 8 core 16 thread AMD-powered laptop with 16gb of ram and 512SSD... If this is at the $400 price point it would be very easy for me to recommend but at $800 I think you can buy something with more flexibility...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Scott Hill,One person found this helpful,,9,2
B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,"Great Quality Screen, Nice Feature set, Good Performance","Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2021","The excellent battery life high quality screen, connectivity and ultra light weight make this Chromebook an excellent choice for anyone that doesn't really want or need the heavy, shorter battery life of a windows laptop. Especially for cell phone users looking for a little more power and something that pairs well with a phone.One of its strongest features is the USB-C connectivity, I was able to connect a multi function dongle to the laptop, plug in a 4k monitor (see the attached photos), connect a full sized keyboard, and a mouse without any issues. The dongle then just sits on my desk with all the hardware hooked up to it, and if I want to connect the laptop to the entire works, I just plug the USB-C plug into the side and away I go. Love that!The battery life if also excellent. I ended up stuck in  a parking garage waiting for someone at a hospital for FIVE hours!(they didn't want vistors because of our little friend mr 19) Where I proceeded to play Frogger the entire time. The battery started with half a charge on it, and was just running out of power when it was time to leave. I don't have any background apps running on the laptop so that extended the battery too. But five hours of frogger is excellent for half a battery!Chromebooks in general give up compute power to gain battery life, the CPU on this is an 8 core model but each core has fairly limited compute capabilities, this means that any app that can't take advantage of all those cores could have issues. This Chormebook has a fairly powerful CPU compared to other Chromebooks, but a good windows laptop will run circles around it.The touchscreen on this Chromebook is outstanding and is a good reason to go with this model. It has excellent color, contrast and brightness. The keyboard is a compact but very useable. It has the dents to help lost fingers find ""home"" and the backlighting is fairly smart, shutting off when I'm not using the keyboard and picking up the lightest touch to turn the backlights on again.The Chrome OS is still maturing and its Linux heritage comes through in several respects, for power users, the Chrome browser acts like a shell where commands can be entered. Also many Google store apps assume a cellphone shaped screen and can't take advantage of the extra screen space.If you have a home that also has Windows computers (like us) this laptop uses a Linux tool that used to be know as Samba for connectivity to windows shares. In the Chrome OS it is possible to connect to those shares with SMB connections but everything has to be setup just right and it can be a pain to connect. Once connected it works well though.This Chromebook lacks orientation sensors which I was hoping it would have,  I would really like to be able to put the laptop on edge while writing papers and have the full length of the screen be usable. (with a keyboard connected via USB) I also can't find a setting that allows me to force it to do that.I wish I had this laptop in college, it would be perfect carrying to class, recording lectures(though it doesn't have a rear facing camera), writing papers, and electronic socializing. Plus it has just enough CPU horsepower to keep all those apps fairly snappy.Running windows: This question is bound to come up and I don't see any reason why this couldn't run windows 10, for windows 11, the CPU is listed under the supported CPU's, it looks like this has the right secruity hardware, but I don't see a UEFI on this laptop which windows 11 requires.Overall this Chromebook is an easy 5 stars with a great feature set and good performance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Persnickety,,,9,2
B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,started off great but freezing up and glitching now,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2021","so first off im going to say that i'm not a chromebook guy, i've always felt that you would be better off with a budget windows laptop simply because the options out there were not great. after using this chromebook for a month my views have changed.chromebooks have always been mostly good for entertainment with a side of light office work, they usually have good screens and great battery life but lack the software support for most users as well as a dismal app selection. i still feel that most users would be better off buying a good mid range laptop for most uses. having said that i feel like this chromebook is the exception to that rule. the cpu is snappy and quickly opens apps and websites, the storage on this is far better than most out there and while its not as good as a laptop with a nvme for storage space, it boots up faster than my usual go to asus laptop which starts up in around 6 seconds. the screen on this thing is beautiful, the colors are sharp and vibrant without being faded or washed out and the brightness is perfect for indoor use and some outdoor use. the keyboard is comfortable and easy to type on without sounding loud and clanky.this model even includes a sim card slot so you can get stuff done even when you don't have wifi around. i tested it out and got strong 4g reception and good download speeds. the tablet modes cool for watching movies on, but its a bit to large to carry it around and use it that way for long but you could totally do that if you want since the touchscreen is so responsive. this chromebook is so good that i've been reaching for it whenever i want to browse or shop on amazon. in fact id say that this chromebook has become my go to device for most stuff other than gaming or anything i absolutely have to have windows for. now, i'm going to point out that this version is more than most decent mid range laptops,in fact its pretty expensive compared to the vast majority of chromebooks i've seen, is it worth it? the answer is a strong maybe. i've been so thrilled with this chromebook for the month i've been using it that i would have said absolutely until a couple days ago when i started having some troubling issues with it.it started out popping up a message that chrome hadn't shut down correctly and asked if i wanted to restore apps, i figured it was a simple error and hoped it wouldn't repeat. unfortunately it did, and then some. in the last three days its started randomly popping up black barcode areas on the screen, they go away if i turn it off and back on but its usually indicative of an issue with the graphics chip getting to hot, not something id expect on a chromebook, especially simply browsing the internet. then it started freezing up and i would have to hold the power button down to force a reboot so it would work again. now i am assuming its an error with the hardware but it could also be an issue with the chrome os update it got a little over a week ago, i haven't heard any other issues from people so i'm still leaning towards a hardware issue and will be reaching out to acer support to resolve this problem. i've bought acer laptops before and have always had good experiences with them so hopefully this time wont be any different.i will update this review once i get that figured out but for now i'm going to have to give it a 2 star rating. for a chromebook costing this much i wouldn't expect to have issues, especially this soon, but i also understand that hardware issues happen to every company. if these issues weren't going on id definitely give this a 5 star, its completely changed my view of chromebooks.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Teddy,,,9,2

B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,More than capable replacement for Windows PC,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2021","I needed a lightweight highly mobile laptop and surprisingly, this Chromebook fit the bill. I was using a Windows Ultrabook but between poor battery life and worsening hardware issues, I found myself quickly needing a replacement. I was already in the process of evaluating this Acer and decided to give it a try. I had initial doubts that a Chromebook could handle all my professional needs, but I also realized the majority of my apps are web based.  This model also isn’t an ordinary Chromebook. It’s designed for business use and has the enterprise option for managed hardware environments. I don’t currently need or use the enterprise enrollment feature but it’s nice to know it’s there if things change.The size and build quality are perfect for frequent transport. The bottom half is plastic, but the lid has an attractive brushed metal finish with polished beveled edges. It’s both attractive and lightweight yet has a sturdy solid feel. There are two USB-C ports. Either port can be used to charge the Chromebook. There are also a USB-type A port, a 3.5mm audio jack,  and a SIM compartment for cellular connectivity. The FHD screen is bright and vivid. Graphics are sharp and crisp with good color saturation and refresh rate. The touchscreen feature is reliably responsive and allows the Chromebook to be used in tablet or tent mode if desired. The backlit keyboard keys have a solid feeling keystroke with good actuation. The muti-touch trackpad seems to work well but I personally can’t stand using trackpads, so I use a USB mouse or the touchscreen.Performance is excellent. I’ve had Chromebooks in the past that felt sluggish and slow. This Chromebook is quick and instantly responsive. It does not at all feel like a Chromebook. It works fine with MS Teams, MS Office apps, my IP phone app and my RMM sites. My only complaint is some of the apps are formatted for mobile devices and don’t appear the same as they do on their Windows counterparts. For example, Teams only works in a small portrait window which leads me to believe it’s the phone version. No Chromebook-specific version is available. Outlook also alerted me that Office apps are being discontinued on Chromebooks and suggested I use OWA. Thankfully, Google Office apps are available offline if needed. So, performance is excellent but there are some compromises with certain apps, mostly from Microsoft. All of my web-based apps work fine, and I can remotely connect to and manage networking hardware as well as servers and other workstations without any issues.  Battery life is outstanding.  I typically use this machine powered on with sleep disabled all day and usually get a full two days of use between charges.The webcam, like most integrated webcams, is mediocre at best. It works okay in well-lit areas but gets noticeably dark and grainy if lighting is less than optimal. The camera also has a scan function for scanning documents and QR codes. The document “scanner” is basically a content aware photograph of the document that can be saved as either a photo file or PDF. The scanner doesn’t perform any transformation or OCR and it also requires bright lighting for best results. It also isn’t the easiest feature to use given that the camera is embedded in the screen and the document should preferably be positioned on a flat surface. If the camera is facing the document, how do you know it’s properly lined up? The document scanner is a good but badly executed. The microphone quality is good. Voices are clear and distortion free with good default gain. The speakers, however, are another story and leave much to be desired. They’re okay for productivity and videoconferencing but that’s about it. They’re flat sounding, not very loud and have zero resonance. Multimedia like music and movies sound flat and lifeless. Even a small set of external speakers would be a marked improvement if planning to use this for presentations or regularly watching or listening to multimedia.One neat feature of this Chromebook is that it effortlessly pairs to Android devices. It paired easily with my Android phone and even automatically configured text forwarding and automatic hotspot. When out and about, if I need internet, the Chromebook automatically connects to my phone.  That’s assuming I decide not to just insert a dedicated SIM card for the Chromebook. One thing’s for sure, this little laptop provides several extras and options. I had my doubts, but it has been a marvelous work machine and I do not at all miss my prior Windows laptop. Yes, this Chromebook carries a premium price compared to others, but as an owner of four Chromebooks in the past, this is by far the best looking, best performing and most like a Windows machine as far as overall performance. The screen quality, build quality and performance are more on par with a decent Windows machine around the same price rather than the typical Chromebook. It’s less than an inch thick and light as a feather yet doesn’t feel cheap or fragile.",5.0 out of 5 stars,SNS,5 people found this helpful,,9,2

When you open it, it's ready to use. * Fits nicely on the lap, without the heat issues you get with a traditional laptop. * When in full tablet mode, the screen is very responsive with no lag at all. * Using it in tablet presentation mode, it takes up very little desk space and is great for watching shows. * Display is bright and vivid. * Battery life is very impressive and remaining life is accurately captured. * I have not tried it, but the cellular data will be a nice feature for traveling or camping.  Came with 2GB of data to try. * Besides the startup and shutdown performance, normal operations are quick as well.  Using Google sheets with large datasets are no problem at all. * Backlit keyboard has a nice feel to it. * USB-C for power means I use my existing power adapters and not have to carry a proprietary cord around, or buy extras. * Having a traditional USB port is nice for connecting thumb drives without having to carry a USB-C adapter around.At first I missed an HDMI connector so I can hook it up to my monitor, but with two USB-C connectors I can use one of my docks if I want to, along with a keyboard and mouse.",5.0 out of 5 stars,M.

B08WPH5VXN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-R841T-R841T-S4ZG,"Fumbles Badly on Zoom, Definitely Not Worth $800","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2021","--------UPDATE TO REVIEW, 10/16/21:--------I originally filed my 5-star review (shown below) on 10/14/21 without testing this Acer Chromebook PC on Zoom. I figured that any $800 name-brand PC released in 2021 could of course handle a Zoom call. Boy was I wrong.I attempted a six-way Zoom call on the afternoon of 10/16/21 using this Acer Chromebook and observed very poor performance. On my end, the incoming videos would often freeze for long periods (five to twenty seconds) and the incoming sound would also go silent for similar periods. On the other end of the Zoom call, the parties reported to me that my video would freeze for long periods, and my sound, when present, was often garbled and impossible to understand.I moved this Acer Chromebook to a position close to our WiFi router, in a different room, to check whether WiFi signal strength might be contributing to these Zoom problems. But the problems persisted.I disconnected this Acer Chromebook from the Zoom call and completed the Zoom call on the Lenovo Windows 10 laptop mentioned in the review below, which was located in the room where I had started the Zoom call on the Acer machine. With the help of an excellent outboard webcam, the Lenovo machine performed beautifully on the remainder of this Zoom call, in stark contrast to the Acer's very substandard and unacceptable performance.This Acer machine might still be an acceptable machine for other purposes, but if you think you might ever use Zoom, buy something else.--------ORIGINAL REVIEW, 10/14/21, under the headline ""A Good PC, but Worth $800?"":--------Perhaps no consumer product is as complicated as a PC. So it is essentially impossible for any PC maker to get every detail ""perfect"" in their products; indeed, it's not even clear what ""perfect"" means in this context.This is not a perfect PC, none are. If I could assign fractional stars, I'd probably deduct 0.2 stars from my rating for the issues discussed below, giving this PC 4.8 stars.This was the first Chromebook PC I have evaluated. Its setup was easy and based on your (free) Amazon Gmail account. This PC offers the option for an Enterprise Administration account, which was claimed to be free, but I didn't activate it as I could not see any use for it as an individual home user. Moreover, I wasn't even sure it was free in perpetuity based on the wording given in the Google website that the setup instructions directed me to.As for the features and vagaries of this PC, where to begin? Well, this laptop is impressively thin and lightweight. And the keyboard has a nice touch and feel, as laptop keyboards go. (I prefer connecting an outboard keyboard, but that's me.) The keyboard backlight feature would be useful in the dark, and it looks cool!The speakers for this PC sound weak and tinny—not even as good as my smartphone's speakers. Although bad speakers are typical for laptop and tablet PCs, these Acer PC speakers seem a little tinnier than average. Much more important, though, is that the headphone sound was excellent. For ear safety, I was glad that the sound volume control did not allow you to set it very high for headphones. I was able to set it plenty loud enough for my ears, but some users who like to blast their ears with headphone music (or who are hard of hearing on account of years of said ear blasting) might wish the headphone volume could be set louder.The screen was shiny, which can cause a problem with the reflection of room light sources. But that problem is not particular to this PC: All PCs I've evaluated have shiny screens. I wonder why they can't make PCs with touchscreens of low reflectivity, such as the screens used on Amazon Kindle devices.The camera on this PC is stunningly good, especially compared to the very poor cameras I've seen on various other laptop and tablet PCs I have evaluated. This Acer's camera seems to be fixed focus, but with an excellent depth of field stretching from about three inches to infinity. The color, detail, clarity, and contrast were all excellent, as was its ability to operate in both bright and dim light.And I was very pleased to discover that this PC's two microphones are used to create a true, sensitive stereo sound system of high quality. (This stands in contrast to another laptop I evaluated that used its two microphones to create not stereo, but a highly directional sound system that worked poorly, and it stands in stark contrast to virtually all outboard webcams I've evaluated, which claim to produce stereo sound but instead employ a single microphone to produce MONOx2.) The only fly in the ointment for this Acer Chromebook's microphone sound system was a faint, low-frequency rumble I could hear through my headphones on the video recordings I made with this PC. This rumble was not external electrical interference, as I detected it at constant strength in recordings made in various rooms of our house and also outdoors. The rumble is so soft that most users would probably not notice it and it would not interfere with using this PC for applications such as Zoom calls. This sound system will provide excellent pickup for a roomful of Zoom participants.I cut my teeth in the computing world on Linux/Unix, and I always install some Linux or Linux-like system on my PCs. As the Chromebook OS is strongly based on Linux, turning on Linux was super easy. It was just a couple of soft-button pushes and a few minutes to wait while the PC ground away. Once Linux was active, however, I immediately discovered that the gcc and g++ compilers were missing. This is likely not Acer's fault, but rather a deficiency in Google's Chromebook OS. After consulting web sources, I eventually found and installed the right deb files to fix this problem.I'm not a PC benchmarking expert and I had no intention of running a standard benchmarking suite on this PC, but I did compile and run a simple C program under Chromebook Linux that performed 20 billion integer multiplications. For comparison, I ran this same simple test on several Windows PCs, compiling the C code there under Cygwin. The running time results are interesting:Acer Chromebook, circa 2021, Qualcomm Kryo 468 Octa-core CPU (Up to 2.4 GHz): 62.5 secLenovo Windows 10 laptop, circa 2021, 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-1115G4 @ 3.00GHz (2 cores, 4 threads): 40.2 secDell Windows 10 Desktop, circa 2014, Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU G3220 @ 3.00GHz (2 cores, 2 threads): 52.2 secAs can be seen above, the Acer Chromebook was slower than even my 2014-vintage Dell Windows desktop, and the Acer performed this task 55% slower than my Lenovo Windows laptop. Based on clock speeds, the slowdown should have been only 25%, not 55%. However, I don't mean to unfairly disparage the Acer over the results of such a rudimentary benchmark. The Acer's eight cores working together can undoubtedly do some amazing things that would advantage it in certain applications, such as gaming. (I did not evaluate the gaming performance of this PC.)On balance, I found much to like in this PC. I do wonder, though, whether it is worth the relatively high price of $800.",2.0 out of 5 stars,MrTechieGuy,,,10,2

B0BY34X9J4,acer-Processor-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Ethernet,Good for the money. Great for school.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","In a whirlwind of tech shopping, I sought my ex-husband's counsel on which computer brand to snag. He's an Acer aficionado and had just snagged one for his biz. He flung a link my way to the very model he bagged. Mid-convo, I stumbled upon a beast with more RAM and storage than a digital warehouse - it was practically a gaming rig in disguise. So, I snagged it. A few weeks in, and it's a love affair with a minor hiccup - the caps lock is a ninja, stealthy and unseen, which I, the accidental samurai, strike all too often. The 10-key pad, squished like a sardine, turned out to be a decorative piece for a touch-typist like me. And the number lock? Also, a master of disguise. You'd think a backlit keyboard would flaunt an indicator or two, but nope. Miskeys are my new jam, but not a dealbreaker. Farewell, touchscreen, hello traditional keys - less memory hogging, more typing. Microsoft 11 S and I aren't buddies, but that's a story for another OS. For school or work?

B0BY34X9J4,acer-Processor-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Ethernet,I'm keeping this one!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2023","This Acer laptop is my third attempt at a new computer.  The first two (different brands) were total frustration.  One advertised backlit keyboard, which it did not actually have.  Second one was advertised as ""new"" and ""2023"", but actually is a 2021 model, possibly refurbished.  But this is a beautiful machine, and so far has delivered on everything advertised. No touch screen, but it was not advertised as having one, and was not high on my list. The battery life is the only ""negative"" I've found so far, but since that had been mentioned in a number of reviews, it was not a surprise, and I can cope with that.  I'm getting a couple hours (3-4, maybe) on battery, which is manageable.  The backlit keyboard is awesome (only lit when in actual use, which conserves battery), and the feel of the keyboard layout and keys is very comfortable.  Screen is bright and sharp for a computer at this level.  Not sure I'll ever be good friends with Windows 11, but we are at least on speaking terms.  Processor is not the fastest available, but for spreadsheets, documents, photo editing, web surfing, etc, it has responded as quickly as hoped for Shipment was timely and packaging was sturdy and secure.  ACER documentation and registration is straightforward  I only dinged it on ""value"" because of the battery life -- this nice of a machine deserves a better battery. Otherwise, I am really happy with this.  Merry Christmas to me!EDIT:  did some research, made a couple of adjustments, and it has helped battery life, I think.

It is faster than any computer I have ever owned, though that isn't saying much. But it _is_ really fast.Folks have complained about the battery life. I suppose it depends on what you use it for-- me, I'm not a gamer.  My old Aspire 1 didn't have a strong battery, but I think this model has a better one.  I can certainly get more than three hours from it without a charge (though I can't imagine when I would ever be using this computer for more than three hours without access to an outlet --I'm an old white guy for whom, for instance, typing away on the beach for more than three hours would be a major skin-cancer risk, and doing so on a plane would make me air-sick).I have some concern, too, about the provenance of this computer.

B0BV4G3XVN,Lenovo-3i-i3-1115G4-Processor-Platinum,Several issues to be aware of,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2023","I wasn't impressed with this laptop despite the mostly good reviews here. Here's the several issues I ran into.(1) Screen quality subpar - I'm not an expert in describing this stuff, but if you aren't directly in front of the screen, viewing quality diminishes considerably. It's also not very bright, nor is it clear.(2) Battery - for me it just drained quickly. I didn't do performance tests,  but I would basically work for a couple hours on light computing to see it drained about 40 percent from new. Imagine how it will do in a year or two?(3) Lenovo service and glitches with Windows - Windows currently doesn't allow the download of most browsers including Chrome unless you turn off something called ""S-mode"". It appears a BIOS update from Lenovo made it impossible for me to turn off S-mode and they offered no service when I contacted them unless I paid for premium support. The issue was their BIOS, but they didn't care, no service from them unless you pay.(4) Cheap feel - Unlike my current, and fairly ancient, HP Pavilion x360 purchased in 2016, everything feels like thin plastic on the Lenovo whereas my HP has lots of metal and more robust plastics. Yes, the Lenovo weighs less, but that's not going to help anyone when you drop it on the floor which will inevitably happen on occasion.Hard pass. Amazon reviews often are lacking, and I don't write many, but given the downsides, I wanted to speak up on this on.  Think carefully and test carefully before settling on this laptop.",2.0 out of 5 stars,TheBrothers,5 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,3,2

My only complaint is about the screen brightness.  It has to be all the way up and it is just barely bright enough.  Turning it down 1 or 2 notches almost blacks it out.  And only from a small angle is the screen clear.  Tilt it too far forward or back and it has a weird sheen that makes colors difficult to see.  (See pics).

Setup was very easy through mostly automation.  Having One Drive ensured that all of my existing applications and settings from my old laptop transferred over seamlessly.  The 20GB memory and 2TB HD is a powerhouse compared to my previous Dell.  The case is solid but light,  The screen resolution is vivid.  Start up time is about 20 seconds.  With 3 USB and one HDMI she is capable although I wish it had an ethernet, I am more that happy.  Shipping was two days and it was packed well in original OEM packaging.",5.0 out of 5 stars,J. L.

B0BV4G3XVN,Lenovo-3i-i3-1115G4-Processor-Platinum,Great laptop!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2022","This is a great laptop. I bout the 1TB HD because I wanted plenty of space and never have to worry. I use this laptop for business and it's perfect. It's very fast and loads programs with ease. It has backlighting on keys which makes the keys much more visible in darker spaces. I have not tried gaming, but I think it would perform pretty average, after all, it isn't designed for that.Windows 11 is nicer and I was quite surprised how much I like it. I'm an old fan of Windows 7. Some of the features with navigation are still a bit more intuitive to find but all in all am pretty happy with the 11 interface.I run office 2010 on this and of course Windows constantly reminds me it's not supported. Whatever Microflop!All in all this is a very nice laptop and a much needed addition to my business management. Battery life seems about 8 hours off charger which is pretty poor but I rarely travel with this so it stays on the charger. For anyone wanting a good price point for a computer with good hard drive space, this is a nice choice!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Brent K,11 people found this helpful,,10,2
B0BV4G3XVN,Lenovo-3i-i3-1115G4-Processor-Platinum,This item was out of warranty before I purchased it.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2023",We have had this laptop for almost a year and now have hardware issues with it- repeated BSOD's due to a harddrive failure.  Lenovo's warranty is one year but according to them it was out of warranty prior to our purchase of the item.  We have tried to contact the seller - there voicemail is full and they have not responded to the message we sent them.  Amazons support tells me that because has been 10-11 months they do not care that the seller is selling items like this and recommended that I contact Lenovo again who again says we are out of warranty.  BEWARE you maybe getting a used laptop and do not expect support from PCOnline or Amazon as they do not care and told me there is nothing they can do!

B0949SGBF8,HP-Touchscreen-Portable-Microsoft-14-dq0070nr,This is a beautiful laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2022","First, this is listed on Amazon as Windows 10 and it comes with Windows 11 so some updating in the description is needed. Not complaining - just sayin'...I needed a quick emergency laptop so ordered this one to use for a few days and as a future backup computer while my huge desktop was in for repair. I am a graphic artist so the only software I could use efficiently on this laptop is the installed MS Office which was no surprise. But what was a surprise is that when I tried to upgrade the MS Office to my business account and also tried to install a browser other than Edge - it slowed down the system considerably.So I'm resetting it to factory settings and using only the Edge browser because as a back up unit for emergencies - I can use the home version of MS Office. I usually only use PowerPoint anyway and for temporary use - the Home version is fine!But now that I understand the limitations along with the other nice features such as touch screen and Windows 11 security features, I'm happy to keep this as a second option in my office that I can use for online only marketing purposes and for my grandson to be able to access his email for classes, etc.The pink color is very nice, by the way, as my office is in pinks, greens, and blacks. So, for what it's built for - it's a very nice option and works great. I definitely recommend that other people try it out!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Susan Daniels,24 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

Firstly the positive, this laptop looks great with that color, it has USB type A, USB type C, SD card ports, HDMI port, the headphone jack, the touch screen works quite well.But the typical HP lack of quality in its entry-level range is noticeable, the plastic of the keyboard part feels warping, the screen is really poor quality. You can't expect much from the processor, but the worst is the 4 GB of ram, it's the minimum recommended for Windows, doing practically nothing and the ram is all in use and it's hard to browse  internet. Another detail is that there are only 64 GB of storage without the possibility of expansion, so you will have to continually free up space and use an SD card for personal files.It's slow, and really, even for just office tasks and browsing, it's exasperating at times.I do not recommend this product.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Sergio,21 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

No scratches, No dents, extremely clean!The setup of windows 10 Pro was a breeze, even the 10 G network over Thunderbolt was / is extremely fast. The i7 CPU, 16 Gb Ram, and Thunderbolt work together extremely well. It only took a few minutes to get ""everything"" set up. After imaging the drive to my NAS for safety reasons, I upgraded to Windows 11 Pro. Now I'm even more impressed! Absolutely error free upgrade to Windows 11 Pro. I'm using a Sonnettech Solo 10 G SFP+ Thunderbolt connection and it is crazy FAST. Reinstalling my software went through error free and really quick. I can definitely recommend this seller and would definitely buy from them again. I definitely feel that I purchased a very good refurbished laptop. Naturally, the 14"" screen is too small for me, but the HDMI port connects to a 27"" Samsung curved monitor which is perfect for me. Having a USB 3.1 hub with 3 ports helps when connection ports are limited. I did notice that 3 keys on the keyboard needed a little TLC because they wouldn't respond 100% correct, but after Q-tip cleaning they worked as designed 😉.I'm very surprised and happy with this purchase!One month update:I have put this laptop through the paces of rigorous office work and high speed network compatibility using a 10 Gb SFP+ Thunderbolt connection. This is awesome!It works flawlessly on my 10 Gb network and can do a complete laptop NVMe drive image in under 7 minutes.

B0BL86VM7F,Acer-Aspire-A515-56-347N-Slim-Laptop,First Impressions: Updated + Update #2,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2023","Update #2:  After about a year of use, still love it.  For those saying the 128GB SSD  is too small, simply add a 1 TB SSD or old HDD as I did (d: drive) in the available motherboard slot for your apps, games movies, etc.).  I did add 4gb of additional ram (now has 12gb) since I had it laying around, but it really didn't need it - ran fine with 8gb.One negative:  Who ever designed the power port should be fired.  It's a 1/8"" jack and not robust at all.  I hit the cable the wrong way and it goes into batter mode.  The jack is a piece of crap and should have been made bigger (like a USB size or 1/4"").Follow my instructions below to clean up the OS, etc. and this thing runs like a champ...Update:(After several months of using): Love it!  Solid as a rock.  It is what it is. A.K.A. Not necessarily the best components (you get what you pay for) but if you know what you're doing (to clean it up), Delete S mode, add a secondary SDD or HDD drive (in my case an old 1 TB HDD), 4 or 8 GB additional RAM (doesn't really need it, delete all the bloatware, disable the items in startup, tighten up all the privacy settings, etc., this thing runs great (everything including sound (some people seem to have issues - but mine's fine).  Not heating up, no slowing down.  Bargain for what you get...-----------------------------------------------Purchased this to replace on older Acer laptop (which is going to the wife to replace her older POS HP). Originally wanted an Acer with a backlit keyboard (like my current one has) but Amazon couldn't seem to send me the correct laptop (twice), so I opted for this one (good price, decent CPU, and 8 GB RAM installed).Went with ACER since I'm happy with my current one, plus it allows you to add more memory, upgrade the NVMe SSD, and an an additional SDD / HDD (which I plan to do.  The 8GB of RAM seems to be doing fine but I haven't really pushed it yet.  The NVMe SSD is half full, but once I install the 1TB HDD from my old laptop I'll load any new programs, music, etc. on that.  This laptop is what it is.  Not high end, and not as solid as my old Acer (keyboard not as solid, etc.) but it's fine so far (except I wish it had a backlit keyboard - miss that).  * Task manager indicates that only one of the two slots are being used by the 8GB RAM (I thought they may have added 4 GB in the 2nd slot to bring it up to 8GB), so, if that's the case, I may add an additional 8GB in the 2nd slot (good idea to add the same size RAM in the 2nd slot, but not absolutely necessary).I had the intent of downgrading to Windows 10 since that's what I'm use to, but decided to stay with Windows 11.  It took a few hours to get used to 11 but in fact, it's not much different then 10 once you get things set up how you want it.  I immediately disabled unwanted apps under task manager startup, deleted unwanted apps (lots of Microsoft crap, and others), turned off S mode, turned off all privacy settings (disabled all the privacy settings that were turned on), and other tweaks.  You can Google ""how to make Windows 11 faster"" for a start for recommended settings / tweaks.  The sound's a bit weak but good enough (speakers are pretty much crap, but what do you expect in a laptop).  There's not much for color / display adjustment, and certain screens look a bit washed out, while others are very vivid (youtube 4K/8K videos look great).  Trackpad works fine (can't stand the tap feature but that can be turned off under the touchpad settings.  Some people report that the laptop gets hot and the fan blows (and is loud) because of that.  I have not seen any indication of that yet (and I hope I don't.  My wife's HP gets extremely hot and the fan is constantly blowing, and I hate it, so I'm relieved that this one is not like that (so far).For the price, and if all you plan to do is surf the Web, check email, stream videos, etc., I highly recommend this laptop.  *  So far, so good...",4.0 out of 5 stars,A.

B0BL86VM7F,Acer-Aspire-A515-56-347N-Slim-Laptop,Nice entry level laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2024","Review for: Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-347N Slim Laptop - 15.6"" Full HD IPS Display - 11th Gen Intel i3-1115G4 Dual Core Processor - 8GB DDR4 - 128GB NVMe SSD - WiFi 6 - Amazon Alexa - Windows 11 Home in S Mode,Silver.This is not the fastest laptop, but it is functional and works well for the price. It has a very nice feature of allowing you to add an internal 2.5"" SATA HDD or SSD. It comes with only a 128 GB NVMe main drive, so the ability to add an additional drive is nice. I had a Samsung 500 GB SSD from my old laptop, so I will have plenty of storage. I got the Samsung drive to speed up my old (HDD) laptop, and it made a big difference. It was actually a little faster than this one with the Samsung SSD. I wish I had made the Samsung drive the boot drive before I got the laptop all set up. But with the NVMe drive I thought it would be a bit faster than my old machine. This is not painfully slow, just not peppy. Using the Samsung SSD as the main (C) drive may have made it faster. I may change it over later. It has one DDR4 slot that is populated with a 4 GB DIMM. There is 4 GB down, giving the machine 8 GB total. I replaced the 4 GB with a 16 GB DIMM. It is built well for an entry level product. The screen bright and crisp. It has a good port selection and even has an Ethernet port. A lot of newer laptops don't have an Ethernet port. It also support WIFI 6. It comes with Windows 11 Home in S mode. I didn't notice the S mode in the description. Thank goodness you can deactivate this mode, or this laptop would have been returned. S mode only allows Microsoft approved apps to be installed. For example: I use Firefox browser, and in S mode I couldn't install it. There are several others I use that wouldn't install. I noticed the price dropped $21 from the time I ordered this laptop until today, when I started to write this review. I called Amazon to see if they would refund or issue a credit for future Amazon purchases. To my surprise Amazon's previously stellar customer service has changed. They say they don't do price matching. I believe price matching is if the product is found at a different store at a lower price. This price change is within Amazon. Amazon wouldn't budge. I did get to a supervisor and she read from the same script (exact verbiage) as the first person I talked to. Supervisors used to have some leeway, like a small gift card for this type if issue, but apparently not any more. I guess Amazon is not interested in customer satisfaction like they used to be. I thought about reaching out the supplier, but decided it is not worth the effort for only $21.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Laura,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2
B0BL86VM7F,Acer-Aspire-A515-56-347N-Slim-Laptop,Great value laptop 4-stars IN ITS CLASS,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2023","This review is for the Acer Aspire 5 A515-56 (8GB, i3-1115G4) edition. According to the box label, it was manufactured July of 2022. It came with BIOS version 1.28 installed which makes sense as that came out on 2022/05/27.  There are four newer BIOS versions with the latest being 1.34 published on 2023/05/12.  The BIOS does not have the ability to install .bin files directly.  You will have to update via Windows or a DOS booter/flasher utility.I have not booted Windows 11 at all.  I immediately installed my own 2.5"" SSD (A 500GB Crucial MX500 that I had already) in the empty drive bay.  Some reviewers have said you are stuck with Windows 11.  This is completely false.  You will however have to disable Secureboot in the BIOS in order to boot off a USB installer before it will let you do anything but run Windows 11.  To do this, you must first set a password for Secureboot.  Then you can disable Secureboot. Then you may clear the password.  It's really not hard at all.I am running the latest Linux Mint XFCE edition, and I'm very pleased with the hardware compatibility.  Everything is working as it should.  Make sure you leave compositing enabled or you WILL get screen tearing when you watch videos.  I have not had any issues with slow speeds or disconnections with the Mediatek wifi.  I do recommend disabling power saving though for optimal performance. It will impact battery life, but odds are you want wifi on anyway, right?I haven't touched the built-in m.2 slot 128GB nvme drive other than to check its SMART stats for failure and hdparm to test speed. It looks like a fast little drive, but my plan is not to use it until I'm 100% sure this laptop will last.  If something goes wrong, I can remove my 2.5"" drive and return it without any fuss, because the Windows OS has nothing on me.  For that reason, I won't try to update the BIOS anytime soon either.  Maybe in a year.The screen is adequate.  It's 60hz, 1080p, and bright enough not to be straining at full.  The trackpad is one of those painted styles with no buttons.  It doesn't track your fingertip very well at all which is annoying but it works.  The worst part is that there is a defined ""middle click"" zone between the left and right sides.  This drove me crazy because middle click defaults to CLOSING windows and tabs.  What a terrible default setting.  Fortunately it's easy to remap (in Linux anyway) so problem solved.The sound is pretty terrible but that's virtually all laptops.  I don't understand why the laptop market suffers so much from bad sound in the era of video viewing and music listening.  Who DOESN'T want great sound out of their laptop in this day and age? Headphones get annoying and don't work for 2 people watching something.  Fortunately, Linux lets you crank beyond 100% out of the box without installing extra EQ tools.  I find I can often go up to 125-150% without distortion or clipping.  You can also get boosted volume out of most decent media players.  No matter what you do though, you will not hear any bass.  Again it's terrible, but even $1000 gaming laptops are equally as lousy with built-in speakers.I paid $300 for this, and I'm happy with what I got.  The fact that it has 3 USB type A and an RJ45 means it's a real computer and not just another ""mobile device"".  I can attach my mechanical keyboard, my wireless mouse, and still have 1 free USB-A slot for a flash drive, external drive, or older smartphone.  The RJ45 means I can plug into a router if wifi isn't working or I need to configure network hardware directly.  An SD card reader might have been nice, but that's something I don't mind using a usb peripheral for.I really think at this price point nothing else compares.  The i3 has only two cores, so I feel the need to keep hyperthreading enabled.

I have owned several laptops from this brand and others and you definitely get what you pay for. If all you need to do is browse the web, watch some movies, or write the occasional paper this is a great option. Gaming of course is out of the question for the most part, though it is not advertised as any sort of gaming machine so i shouldnt be surprised!

I always choose a laptop with the number panel on the right for the right hand.  They included a minuscule ""enter"" button , which most other brands give a double high key to.  Usually over that, there is a plus sign, also double size which isn't on this.  The F Keys are a mess and there are symbols on top keys I've NEVER seen before.  This is not a user friendly keyboard, having come from  a Lenovo and Chromebook before this.  It just keeps letting me down in user friendliness.  You seriously couldn't spring for a single light, even the POWER one, on this model????? Way to cheap out ACER.  Already waiting for this 4 month old to die, so I can ethically buy a new one that will NEVER be your brand againUPDATE!!!!! Not 2 months in and the charger- piece that goes into laptop- disintegrates!! Some pieces still inside charging port of laptop. It no longer takes a charge!!! I am BEYOND!!!  This laptop is the biggest pile of crap I ever wasted money on!!  Take your money and RUN!!! @ Acer, I am coming for you- today is Christmas- tomorrow I intend to blow you and yours up until you do right by me!!! 2 solid months of the most pathetic product you should be ashamed to put your name on……@Amazon- why are you even letting these POS market their crap under your banner????

I'm taking 15 credits in college and basically have homework 7 days a week. Today, I put it in sleep mode to take a break. When I came back, it was pulsating (video) for almost 20 minutes. It seemed to be fine after that, but I contacted Acer and they said there was a defect and it should be replaced. So, I contacted Amazon and they can only refund the money to get a new one...AFTER I send the laptop back to them! That would mean about a week that I would have no laptop to do homework on. They suggested talking to Acer - again - which I did. They said that sales thru Amazon don't connect to Acer, so Amazon is the only one that can refund/replace the laptop.I am not able to do my assignments on computers at the college, as they require specific programs that are not able to be installed on public computers. So, my only option is to keep a defective laptop and PRAY it doesn't die on me while I'm still in school for the next 3 months. NOT COOL AMAZON !!!

B08LBZRVLG,Acer-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Dual-Core-Processor,Great around the house appliance!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2024",Have never done a Chrome Book before but we wanted to have something for convenience around the house and for travel and shopped for quite a while to find the right combo of features at the right price. We're very happy a couple of months in with this while I wouldn't get it for anything but casual use...I don't know how we lived without it now! I come from Dos/Windows/Android systems and there was and is still a bit of adjustment needed and my guess is ios users would have more of an adjustment.We're very happy with the screen quality and the touch screen functions...just getting to scroll easily is a major plus. Makes a nice bridge between tablets and pc's and I have a real keyboard. The 12 hour battery means I don't even bring my adapter with me most places...and since it is usb C on the charger...I can use a cord on anything to top it up away from home or in the car. I wish the screen would do a full foldover so I could really use this as a tablet...but those seem quite a bit pricier. Streaming video and youtube with a decent connection is just fine but a gamer would want something more. My wife enjoys doing her email and pictures of family and the ease of use and uses this exclusively now.Obviously there are some high end Chrome books and some cheaper ones too...but we had modest demands and got them for a modest price and couldn't be happier with the choice.,5.0 out of 5 stars,camaraderie,6 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

B08LBZRVLG,Acer-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Dual-Core-Processor,Very Good for the Price,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2022",I bought this just to tide me over because my MacBook Pro’s keyboard broke. I bought a Chromebook about 5 years ago and they have definitely improved. This Chromebook is very good. Scrolling can sometimes be choppy. The screen is very good. Images are crisp. I don’t do formal testing but I did put it side by side against the HP Omen gaming laptop I bought a year before and they are quite comparable when watching HD videos from YouTube. It starts up quite fast which is expected. I used Microsoft 365 while I had this laptop and it’s probably the only negative for me. I’d rather have it installed.I am very happy with this product but I gave it to my father so he can have a new laptop. I bought another one that is more expensive (a proper laptop) and I’m more satisfied with this Chromebook. No issues here except: I don’t like that they say it’s 2022 when it’s manufactured in 2018 and the updates only last until 2027. Don’t get me wrong. I’d still have bought it because I don’t plan to use it past 2027 anyway.I may buy the 17” version of this Chromebook just to have it for watching videos and browsing. It’s not that much more compared to this version although the 17” one is not touchscreen.,5.0 out of 5 stars,ScribeNurse,24 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2
B08LBZRVLG,Acer-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Dual-Core-Processor,"Sent in for ""repairs"" right after receiving it.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023","I purchased this item brand new and it wouldn't connect to the internet except as a guest.  I had to wait until the next morning for tech support to arrive to work.  They walked me through steps to try to reset it back to factory specs (???) which it got stuck at about the third step.  She told me they would send me labels for FedEx to pick it up, I told her I didn't have a printer, she said FedEx would have the QR label.  After two more phone calls, I found out I have to jump through hoops, find a FedEx onsite place, after waiting a day for the QR label to hit my e-mail, take it to an onsite location where they can use my email to print out the label and send the computer in for repairs.  Due to my health problems, none of this can happen.  I have to send my phone with someone else, to the next town over to the nearest FedEx onsite location, with my ""NEW"" CHROMEBOOK, to ship it back, wait for them to receive, fix it, return it to me, and hope it works.I have had two Chromebooks in the past and loved them both.  Unfortunately, I will never trust this machine now, and I will never buy another Chromebook.  Lost a lifelong customer over this one.  What happened to ""We'll send you a new one?""  If you send out a faulty item, you don't ask the customer to jump through hoops so you can make repairs and send the same crappy item back to the customer!  You send them one that works in the first place!!Update:  I received my Chromebook on 11/29 (my sister received hers the same day, same problem).  I was able to get it shipped out on the 12/5 via FedEx using Acer's QR label in my Gmail.  It was supposed to be delivered on 12/8 but got hung up and wasn't returned to them until 12/11.  I received at email saying it was received and would take 7-10 BUSINESS days for a certified technician to look at the machine.  This is the worst customer service I have ever seen.

No, it's Chromebook, which I didn't really mind until IN came across these 2 stupid, stupid changes. So they thought it was a good move to get rid of the caps lock button, where it has been sitting cozy for 30+ years for all of us to use, they replaced it with a ""search"" button. So now, instead of gracefully typing away, quickly pressing and depressing the caps locks, very quickly, now instead I have the option to even quicker than before to get to a search bar. And even worse, despite having a normal size touchpad, rather than being able to quickly and flawlessly press the bottom right of it to ""right click"", the option is completely void, and in order to right click, you must use two fingers, which you don't get timed right most of the time. So even though the spot to do it is still literally on the keyboard, they just thought they'd put their own spin on it, stupid, no sense, spin.

B08LBZRVLG,Acer-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Dual-Core-Processor,Incredibly Slow - Used Laptops Are Faster,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022","Pros:- Battery life is fantastic. I easily get 10 hours of use- Touchscreen works well, and the lid is sturdy enough to handle touching the screen- Touchpad is comfortable- Webcam is fineCons:- Incredibly slowIt was lightning fast at first, and I was very happy. But after it updated to ChromeOS 100+, it has since become frustratingly slow and laggy. YouTube and Twitch streams stutter, and videos often freeze while audio continues. Takes about 15-20 seconds to straighten out then it's smooth from there on.  Powerwashed three times, uninstalled all non-standard apps. Hasn't helped. Mouse began stuttering with ChromeOS 107.- TouchpadThe cursor will at one point be way too slow and sluggish or stutter, and other times fly across the screen because it's too fast. Almost like it's trying to catch up.- KeyboardIt has a texture that reminds me of 100 grit sandpaper. I don't care for it.Overall:Battery life comes at the cost of performance. If you're like me and can't stand laggy machines, skip this one. I blame ChromeOS, not the hardware itself.

B08LBZRVLG,Acer-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Dual-Core-Processor,Stopped Working,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2024",It’s a beautiful Chromebook and my daughter loved it - especially the touch screen feature. Great for her school work but it stopped working. No one could get it to turn on and it would not charge. They sent me a replacement item and after a few months same thing happened. She is really sad and I am beyond disappointed. I’ve always felt badly when reading reviews of paying customers who received poor products. I’ve always felt so lucky that I got a good item. Guess my luck ran out. Will never order this again and am now worried about where to get a reliable Chromebook. These things are so mass produced and refurbished.

I wanted a laptop that looks nice, that is good quality, but not enough to viciously eat up a huge chunk out of my money. I want to spend only what’s necessary, and luckily I found this laptop. I read the positive reviews which made me feel motivated, yet made me nervous at the same time when seeing the negatives.✅Honestly I’m glad I ignored them because this laptop is good, it works perfectly fine. The touch screen is very convenient when writing my essays, short stories, or when I’m doing my math assignments/exams online, and when I’m watching YouTube/Netflix in my spare time. I’ve had a much smaller laptop previously, so it was weird for me when typing on this laptop because it’s bigger than my old one, but thankfully I’ve adapted eventually. The sound/speaker is good, I can hear it loud and clear. The face cam is good, I use it for my zoom classes and it works great. No complaints as of yet. Also the charger that comes with it is completely new, clean, and functional—I don’t know if it’s just me? But the first time I used the charger? It got hot, like really hot when I first used it. It was only that first time and then it never happened again after some uses. I often forget to unplug the charger when I’m not using it but it never was hot when left in that state—but regardless I put it away as soon as when I don’t need it, don’t want it to blow up or something. The battery life is amazing, it last the whole day and I only charge it before bed since it charges up really quickly, so it’s not necessary to leave it plugged all night till ya wake up. Hell you can even charge it the next morning and you’ll be fine. Also there’s two sides where you can charge your laptop both left and right, along with it has an extra volume buttons on one side. The power button has a light that’ll blink softly on and off when you haven’t turned it off completely to let ya know that it’s still on. Overall I don’t have any complaints about the laptop, it’s the best laptop I’ve had.⚠️Though I must remind you that the keys do not light up, so you’re going to have to have a light near by, unless you already have the keys memorize then you’re fine. I don’t mind using a light, after-all I’ll be using this laptop a lot for a while—I’ll probably won’t need the light near me by that point. Don’t place too much pressure on the touch screen it’s not necessary, or else you’ll damage it. Screen quality is great, I have anything negative to say about it…just that it’s too bright? Wish it had a dark mode.⚠️I must give ya a heads up that the laptop could break for the screen side of the laptop itself, with enough heavy pressure or impact it could damage the screen. It’s pretty bendable if you put enough force on it—but why would anyone in their right mind do something like that?? If anything, everyone knows ya have be really careful not to drop it, place anything too heavy on the laptop, or bending the screen. Be aware of the backpacks with laptop pockets, most of them do not have padding on the bottom, or enough of it, and it can damage the laptop if being too careless. To be honest all laptops can get damaged if not being too careful. So just care for it when taking it outside of your home. Again I wish it had dark mode, but that’s just my only complaint, or more like me nitpicking…but other than that it’s a good product.In conclusion, it’s works great for school, Listening to music on it, for watching movies, and is overall good quality. It’s not so expensive, and it worth buying this laptop. I will update this further on in the future if there’s anything negative or positive to add, and I’ll even add a video later, so you can see the laptop before making your purchase 👍.Hope this helped you make up your choice whether or not to buy this laptop, good luck!🍀👍UPDATE:11/21/22It’s has dark mode now, and so far the laptop is still working perfectly well! I have no problem with the touch screen, the battery life is still amazing, and I have no lagging/glitchy problems at all so far. Again this is a APP based kind of laptop, so there might be other programs you use that might not work on this laptop. My review is still the same, I like this product, and for it’s price! Also I added a video review too! Happy thanksgiving 🍁UPDATE: 06/13/2023Still no complaints! My laptop still functional! ^^",5.0 out of 5 stars,@Isabel,129 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

B08TH23KK5,HP-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Entertaining-Bluetooth,Amazing laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2022","I  purchased  this  refurbished  laptop a few weeks  ago. I purchased it mostly for my  catering  business. I have a desktop computer. I can be on a computer for hours  handling business and sometimes I don't want to sit on at my desk at my desktop computer.  Having this laptop lets  me sit in bed and handle everything for my business with ease. You can  handle a lot because you can have multiple tabs open at once.  It's works with Goggle only not Microsoft. Which, is fine with me because my business documents  are in  Google docs. I prefer Google anyway. It is lighting fast with my Wifi. I like that I can download apps directly  from the Google play store. It even has a camera so I am able to do a Zoom meeting from it.  The touch screen feature is great and the touch pad  feature works well.  You can choose to enter a pin instead of a password when you first turn on the computer or to wake it from sleep mode. It does not have a fingerprint scanner. It's a nice blue color as well. The keyboard does not light up. That's not too big of a draw back for me. The speakers on it are okay I'm not expecting much sound from a laptop speaker. The battery life is freaking amazing it has a 12 hour battery life. It even tells you the battery percentage and how much time you have left before it needs to be charged like a cell phone. I have gone days without charging it and it hardly lost any battery power.  It even has blue tooth, headphone jack, and a 1 hdmi port.  You can flip the screen to use it as monitor  or flip it all the way back  to use a tablet. It does not have caps button. The caps button was replaced with a search  button. When you press the  search button. You can for  look for anything quickly. It can be something on Google,  on you laptop, apps, anything. Just  press or hold down the shift  button for caps. The screen does not detach from the keyboard.  Guess what I'm using to write this review?!  For whatever reason you need a laptop.

B08TH23KK5,HP-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Entertaining-Bluetooth,Good battery!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2023","Awesome computer for my needs.  Been using it for about a month or more.  Battery is great!  Only complaint I have is with the screen viewing angle.  Its limited as to which angle you can see the screen.  You almost have to be directly in front of it to see it perfectly bright and clear.  Not directly but almost.  Computer is very light for a 14 inch laptop, and its yoga style makes it easy to carry around.  Its like having a king size tablet for quick demonstrations, graphs and videos.  Before this I mainly used a 10 inch tablet for those business needs so having this was a huge upgrade for me.  I use it as both a tablet and a laptop.  I use it almost everywhere I go for my computing needs.  Lighter than your typical laptop which is great.Power: I run a web based business and so far so good.  It runs all the programs such as wix, dispatching software and google documents.  For my needs it is fast enough.  I go on roblox to spend time with daughter with word games and other games on the site and it runs fine for that but lags on some of the more advanced gaming.

I've always used the higher end Chromebooks, and become spoiled with how easily they can replace traditional laptops.  This was my first foray into the budget models (I got it refurbished for $180) and I really got what I paid for.  The processing speed is too slow to help you forget traditional laptops.  It is a perfectly good couch computer.  You know, the one you leave plugged in on the couch and use to scroll social media an e-mail while watching equally mindless television.  If you need to use this for any form of work, I highly recommend dropping a few dollars more on something that isn't powered by a 1980's graphing calculator processor.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Nate,,Verified Purchase,1,2

Only half the memory has been used, is scanned regularly for viruses, and everything is updated but it will crash over and over whenever our child tries to watch shows on Netflix, or play their games which is frustrating. If you're looking for something to type up a paper or stream YouTube it will work but be prepared for crashing after a few months of use.

If you are looking to purchase this to use CRICUT design space DONT - The one you have to download to use for this is just the APP version and you only have limited features you can use and make it very difficult to get anything done.

The screen quality is almost as good as my MacBook: she tells me no lagging when she plays roblox/Minecraft on it. The feel just feels quality. I spent less on this one than her old one and it was slow from the beginning. She and I are very happy with the purchase. And it's blue her favorite color! She loves she can use it as a tablet if she wants but also as a laptop when she wants also.

Only downside to me is that it cannot play video games outside of games on the Google Play Store, but that is a function of being a chromebook so if you got this far that probably is something you are aware of already.

B08TH23KK5,HP-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Entertaining-Bluetooth,Faulty and broken product,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2022","While this refurbished computer worked for about a month, it has now become a paperweight and a total waste of my money. I should not have bought a refurbished computer, I see that now. One, after a month the keyboard wouldn't work and we could only use the touch screen. I asked for a refund and they insisted that they work through the problem rather than give me my money back. It was back and forth and they wanted me to call them, not supply me with a replacement or give me my money back without a struggle. Since my son needs the computer for his online school, I opted to keep the screen at a certain angle so that the malfunctioning keyboard would work some of the time. Then the screen turned a grayish color and all the display was distorted. I power washed (as it factory reset) the computer, but it is a hardware issue and the local computer repair shop said it was not worth it to repair. It's too late for a refund and I'm not pleased with the fact they wouldn't refund me my money when I asked. So, I went to a brick-and-mortar store and bought a new computer where I can return the product if it doesn't work properly. I'm disappointed and frustrated with the whole mess. I will never buy a refurbished computer again and won't work with this company again.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Christina Miles,6 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,5,2

This is my first Dell, and it did not disappoint!  I am surprised how thin the laptop is and there is no external battery.  Seems to have wonderful battery life and amazed at the 3 USB ports plus a USB C port.  I wasn't expecting for this laptop to have bluetooth, and it does!  Everything seems to work right, the laptop itself seems sturdy and made well.  Not a big fan of windows 10, but this seems to work well on this device.  Screen is great, watching Amazon prime movies on here is a treat, and the sound quality is excellent.  I don't plan on using this for games so I will not be a good source for those types of questions.  Only con I have is the loss of a dvd/cd drive. RIP.

B08FNQ3XTR,Dell-Latitude-7480-Laptop-i5-7300U,"Great product for the money, but need to make sure it's been ""renewed""","Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2024","Physically, the laptop I received looks brand new, with some slight wear around the USB-C port that's hardly worth mentioning. The screen was scratch free, and no perceptible wear on the keys or touchpad. The power supply was obviously used, and even came with a sample of the previous owners hair (gross!). Battery life has been great. After the initial charge, I've been running (mostly idle) for over two weeks and battery life is just under half. All in all, I'm very happy with the condition of the laptop.Now for the bad. The laptop had not been ""renewed."" It booted up to a login screen for the previous owner's domain (BP Oil). There was no way for me to directly login. I had to log into the BIOS and force it to boot from USB so I could access it. After getting in, I could see that the previous owner's files were still there. I reformatted the drive and loaded a fresh copy of Windows 10 and I'm able to use it as I need to now, but this would be a deal breaker for most people. The former owner (BP Oil) and their vendor (TekRefurbs.com ) broke every rule in the cybersecurity rulebook on this one. They need to do a better job at protecting their assets.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Eric Slate,7 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

It started out with a battery issue that Amazon support help. Yet the laptop wouldn't boot to Windows login.  Amazon support couldn't assist with this and Dell wanted $99 out-of-warranty fee. P.S. I even downloaded an OS recovery USB and it didn't work!UPDATE! It's now a solid 3 🌟  I was able to get the unit to accept the USB recovery from DELL's website. My other concern is I was promised by Amazon Tech Support that I would receive a partial refund or special credit for my inconvenience and that they could not assist me in resolving my issue.

You will have to connect your internet with an ethernet cable.. Before my purchase I read the questions and reviews where someone said it DID have wifi but I can tell u first hand that IT DOES NOT have wireless internet..  Right time I turned it on for the 1st time, it asked me to plug up my ethernet cable to connect my internet..  I also tried in the setting to hook up to my wireless internet and wireless was not even an option..  Don't get me wrong, It looked great with only 2 very small scratches on the side and it was just like opening a brand new computer when i started it up..  Next, the mouse also didn't work when I tried to scroll down and I'm sure it was like that from the old user but everything else worked..  It's not a bad buy but Remember, You Are Buying A Refurbished Laptop not a new one..  I'm sending it back and already just went ahead and ordered a new one since I have it extra money right now and since it's a Christmas present..

During that time, I had no other issues with it. New laptop is scheduled to arrive later today. I hope the transition will run smoothly.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Dee,,Verified Purchase,2,2

B0BN2FG7MJ,HP-Laptop-i5-1135G7-Processor-Anti-Glare,Good Product,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2023","The laptop works great. I am happy with product. However, the seller is impossible to get a hold of other than through Amazon. They provided a phone number on the box which I called 4 times and never received a call back. Windows 11 Home would not activate. That was the reason why I was trying to contact the seller. I did not hear from them so I called HP. HP stated the reason Windows would not activate was that the seller did not use Genuine HP parts when they upgraded the laptop which flagged the system. It also voided the manufacturer's warranty on those specific parts. HP helped me solve the problem since they have 24/7 service,  and this was a Friday evening. I received instructions from the seller the following week on how to fix the problem which I had already corrected with HP's help. Seller warrants the whole machine for 1 year, but my question is how does one get service if they cannot contact the seller easily I am not happy with the seller due to the inability to be able to reach them easily.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Lindsey N Mikash,17 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,2,2

Shortly after the two week return window closed, this computer started to fall apart.  Here is a list of what went wrong: the keyboard keys stick-including spacebar and entire bottom row; the computer wont hold a charge; computer won't turn on at random; it overheats constantly, even when not in use and closed; overheating slows system down; screen cuts out or glitches, goes black randomly and flickers; crashes for no reason;  won't accept a charge from the power adapter it came with; computer remains dead  often while plugged in; the fan is always running (loudly)  gets hot even when not open or on; restarts when closed; and last but not least the tap pad doesn't respond.  In a customer service chat with Amazon, I was told that if the third party seller did nothing, Amazon would assume responsibility. Of course, the third party seller did nothing, and Amazon changed their mind and said they too would do nothing.  The computer was a gift for my daughter for college, cost $550, and is now just an expensive piece of clutter for her dorm room.  So disappointed.

Apple I would give 2.5 stars to on this one.What I didn't realize is that Apple totally screwed up their product by skimping on the camera.

The only damage I've noticed is a small scratch on the side/corner of the laptop (on a profile that I don't frequently check), a smear on the screen that I am unable to wipe off, and damage to a few of the letters on the keyboard. The laptop didn't arrive the cleanest, but I was able to clean it off myself. I recommend this for students or individuals on a budget.

B084Z6RK9C,Apple-Macbook-Air-13-3-MVFJ2LL,"Overall, what you'd expect","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2023","So, I did not necessarily have amazing expectations for this, but it works fine for school. Price was very good considering the product, which can go for like $1000 brand new. Here's my ratings for different categories:Battery:Well, this category really is not great. The battery life is not good at all. It drains very quickly and takes a long time to fill up.A 100% charge might last 1 - 2 hours of continuous, non-heavy use.It takes around 3 hours to fill from 0% to 100%. So... better off using it as a desktop than a laptop.Keyboard:It's a keyboard. It works as a keyboard. Not a ton to say. The only negative about this is that there is a weird white splotch on the S and D keys that is ingrained into the keys itself. It will not come off with rubbing alcohol and seems to be stuck in there.Heat:This thing gets QUITE hot while charging and using. Not to mention the fans are pretty loud for lightweight use like browsing the internet and using Microsoft word.Screen:The screen came pretty flawless and works great, no complaints.Lag/Usability:Okay, this is really disappointing. The main reason I got a mac was to replace the incredibly slow school Chromebook I was issued. For a 600, almost 700 dollar computer, this is pretty laggy and slow. It can be incredibly frustrating at times.Scratches:A few minor scratches on the bottom, not very noticeable. Perfectly fine.Would I recommend it?If you have low expectations, sure. If you want the high-quality experience that you might be used to on Windows laptops or your iPhone, you will not get that with this product. I would not recommend this to friends or purchase it again. I do not believe this is necessarily the sellers fault, but I will say if you want a refurbished mac book I would likely go with a recent macbook pro model if given the chance to purchase again. DEFINITELY get the asurion protection plan recommended to you by amazon, 70 bucks for 2 years is very good and quite a nice safeguard.Overall, 3.5 stars. Seller was prompt with shipping, and did a good job for the value. My grievance is more with the laptop itself than the seller.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Danny Sboto,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,2,2

As we all know buying a refurb Mac off Amazon can be a risky business. I took that risk even further by going for the cheap “acceptable condition” category. Anxiety all the way up to delivery. But can say it was packaged appropriately, no immediate visible damage, screen was fully clear, and turned on and functioned properly. Thanked the Amazon gods today. Of course, there’s a few imperceptible dings/scratches, but I put a case on anyway so doesn’t matter, at least to me. And, of course, 3rd party charger. I’m now pretty deep into it and everything still smooth as can be.One caveat I will say, the battery health could be a little better. But I really just need to hold me over maybe 2-3 years til I can get the Mac upgrade I really want.

I thought maybe if I kept editing it would be fine, BUT the computer restarted itself. So no editing for me. Another issue is that when I am watching movies on full screen while charging, the screen glitches sometimes, like it turns the brightness up and down really fast.I wanted to return it but sadly for me I live in the Galápagos Islands, and sending it all the way back to the states is not an easy task, so ill just keep it and try to be happy with what I got.

To make a long story short the laptop did come to me dead which was a slight hindrance. The laptop itself is in pretty good condition. I just had a small crack on mine. However, it wasn’t noticeable and it’s on the side where you can’t really see unless you’re paying close attention. The biggest issue I had was my space key. It was giving me a hard time and I would have to press on it hard for it to work. Long story short I read somewhere to flip the laptop over and hit where the space key should be at  on the back of the laptop. I did it three times (not too hard of course) and it worked. It was slightly annoying due to the fact I just got my laptop yesterday and I had these issues. However, overall it was worth it. The laptop itself is very stunning and like I said in good condition.

Expecting some visible dings.. because that’s what it says. It also says to expect everything to function and battery health will be 80% or better.. The battery is so bad it has a warning next to it saying service is recommended and the space bar is completely stuck meaning I have to mash it pretty hard to actually space. I bought this with the sole purpose of writing my ebooks and the one thing I wanted to do is made difficult and fairly unenjoyable because the space bar is practically useless. Would NOT recommend this option.I wanted a beater computer that can handle running Google docs and light internet surfing, nothing fancy. It was almost there, as in, the computer turns on, charges, and can be updated which is great but being that it’s a Mac fixing the space bar may mean fixing the entire keyboard which might run me the cost of the computer.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Jessica Dadarria,,Verified Purchase,8,2

However, I decided to give it a shot this time. Turns out I made a mistake. There are some obvious cosmetic defects in appearance, which is not out of expectation given the fact that this is not a new one. What is not acceptable and makes me decide to return it is that when I was transferring the data from my old IMac to it, it restarted all of a sudden with the screen showing something like ""the computer needs to restart because of a problem."" So I had to start over everything. The same situation happened again and again afterwards, which drove me crazy. It was just three days after I received it. What would happen after I keep it and use it for six months, one year, or two years? Money is one thing, but what if it totally collapses and the personal files stored in it can't be retrievable?  So the best option for me is to return it before anything worse happens. I will not make the same mistake again.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Sienna C,,Verified Purchase,9,2

I was happily surprised when it arrived the next day (early).  When I took it out of the box, it looked perfect.  That is where the good things ended.The battery was not fully charged, but that was ok.  I plugged it in, but it did not charge while I was working on it.  When I removed the charger, the battery icon said that the charger was still plugged in (it was not).  I tried charging while the laptop was closed.  No dice.  The battery charging icon never went away, no matter if the charging cord was plugged in or not.Then one time I went to open the screen, and the entire screen was filled with horizontal lines. Mind you, I had only had the laptop for two days and had been on it for an extremely minimal amount of time.I immediately  contacted the seller, Who I assumed was Amazon, but it turned out it was a third-party seller. The seller told me that I should take the computer to a computer repair shop and have it assessed and then send them the report. I informed the seller that by live in a rural area and an extremely far away from any type of shop like that. In addition to that, the seller wanted me to take pictures of every angle of the computer and send them to her.I then requested to just have a replacement computer sent to me since I just received this last week. The seller informed me that they do not do this, and told me that I could return the computer for a refund, but I would have to again send them pictures.I’m extremely frustrated by this entirely process.  I received a defective product and the seller should step up and try to make it right instead of putting all of the burden on me.  I would definitely not recommend to anyone and would NEVER, EVER buy from this seller.",1.0 out of 5 stars,geauxstate,45 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,9,2

I received this computer a few days ago, I downloaded that latest IOS and synced it with my iCloud. I started to notice that every time the computer sat idle it would completely shut down and after booting up every app and document would be erased. This happened several times and after messing around with some settings it seemed to be ok. Well today it happen again during a client meeting and my computer shut down in the middle of a presentation and tried to reboot 7 times.

My MacBook came in just about PERFECT condition. Literally the only thing wrong with it was the screen had a very small scratch on the far left end that I didn’t notice until day 2 of having it (which is to be expected, it’s RENEWED) but everything else was perfect. Biggest hesitation with getting the i5 Air was hearing about the loud fan and overheating. I don’t do any heavy video editing or gaming on it (and if you do, you should be getting a pro anyway), but I do have a lot of zoom meeting throughout the week and do a lot of streaming and the only time the fan ever had to turn on was during an update. I’ve never had a problem with overheating. 10/10 would highly recommend if you’re ballin’ on a budget and need a new MacBook. I wouldn’t let the bad reviews scare you.

You type one word and the Chromebook types up something else..Expect for this one small problem and it started just after a month or so after I had purchased this.Once awhile it wouldn't turn back on after I had idling for whatever time it took to be in power saving mode butIt wouldn't turn back on, everytime when this happens I have to press the side power button for about ten seconds to turn it off first then, I'd give it a minute before hitting the same power button again. I hold it just long enough to see the blue light goes on next to power button you just pressed. Oh just out of curiosity, what does the power button do located right top corner?

B08NTP5RTN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-311-CP311-2H-C7QD,Amazing College Computer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2023","I genuinely don’t think I have any complaints about this product. Prior to buying this computer, I was very against buying a touch screen computer because there seemed to be too many cons and not enough pros, such as a hyper sensitive screen and a battery that dies faster. This is not the case whatsoever with this laptop. I’m now a college student, but I’ve used the computer since Senior year of high school and it’s worked amazingly for getting homework done. I also love the 360 rotation, which allows me to turn the computer into an tablet as well as display any work very effectively. The only thing is, if you are looking to play games alongside doing your work, this may not be the laptop for you, as gaming runs incredibly slow. With that, it is a Chromebook, so all accessories and app stores are associated with Google, and you may not be able to access some apple or Samsung only apps from this computer, though this hasn’t seemed to be an issue for me. Beyond that, I swear by this computer. Also, the battery life is great. Often times I watch shows in school, and I’ve never had an issue with it dying on my prematurely. In fact, the battery life lasts a full days use, and I charge it over night. Definitely recommend if you’re looking for a computer for schooling.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Todd,12 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

B08NTP5RTN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-311-CP311-2H-C7QD,"GREAT upgrade from tablet for my kids, first Chromebook","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2022","I did a lot of research as to what to get for my kids to replace their aging and damaged Samsung Tab A's. We decided that it was time to go to a Chromebook so that they could get more repetition with a standard keyboard and GoogleOS. They are still able to download all the PlayStore apps that they had on their tablets, but now with better hardware and longer support.This model has 64GB of storage (with SD card option), so thats a huge upgrade. The RAM is 4GB, which is more than most cheap tablets these days, and you can tell. Its a LOT snappier than the Galaxys.The 2in1 flip with the screen is my kids favorite part! They can use it like a ""real computer"" and then flip it to make a huge tablet screen instead. Much bigger than the 8"" screen they had before.For an entry level chromebook, these are sturdy, snappy, and cheap! I dare you to find something better for preteens at this price point!NOTE: some of the reviews here complain about the speaker quality/power. This was one of the only things I was weary about when I finally committed to this unit. Those reviews are DEAD WRONG. The speakers are GREAT on these Chromebooks. The quality is clear, and they are louder than both of my other laptops and tablets. Playing videos through YouTube at 1/2 volume is much louder than the max of my other units. Don't let the ""terrible speaker"" reviews sway you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A.Mom,66 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2
B08NTP5RTN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-311-CP311-2H-C7QD,"Excellent lightweight, reasonably priced Chromebook, but not a good substitute for an iPad","Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2022","Assessment after six months: This is an excellent low priced Chromebook overall, with fine screen quality and light weight. Set up was easy as is true of most Chromebooks. I purchased it to replace an older iPad, which I liked but was slow, and lacked connectivity and available keyboards. This Chromebook has two USB-C ports and two standard USB ports.  The keyboard is first rate and the track pad is good enough that I don't need a mouse. Accessing files on a USB key is easy enough on a Chromebook but impossible on an iPad. I have encountered only two significant drawbacks. The first is a touchscreen that is slightly  inferior to the iPad. Those of us who are new to the Chromebook need to realize that it is a hybrid: in some respects it resembles an iPad and in others a PC, with advantages and disadvantages compared to either one.  This particular Chromebook is not appreciably faster than my six year old iPad.Google Play for the Chromebook is inferior to the Apple App Store in terms of available apps but apps are generally easier to install than with a PC. In many cases you have the choice of accessing a website through an app or via Chrome. If you are used to using airline apps on your iPad or android smartphone you will find that they either aren't available (American, Southwest) or are available only in the reduced size smartphone version (United, Delta). This should not prevent you from accessing the airline's entertainment system through Chrome but I find that a bit less convenient. I find using Word documents on the Chromebooks inconvenient since you cannot download and run Microsoft Office, although the online version can be utilized. At best if you are a serious Word user you will find the Chromebook workarounds lacking in convenience.  Editing .docx documents is easy enough with google and experienced users probably have methods that I haven't yet figured out.  I  considered purchasing a basic iPad 2021 (9th version) with a keypad, but the cost is twice that of this Chromebook, which has a larger (11 inch) screen is larger than the iPad and not much heavier than an iPad with a keyboard case.I purchased the Chromebook as a substitute for an iPad (lower price, larger screen) but after six months the disadvantages for me outweigh the advantages. Using Word (or PowerPoint) on the iPad is pretty much seamless as long as you keep your files on the cloud; on the Chromebook it awkward unless you want to use Google drive more or less exclusively. Another disadvantage, although manageable, is browsing the news or other daily feeds. As with your office computer you can access the source's web address but the handy apps that are available for the iPad or a smartphone frequently are not available at all or do not work properly on the Chromebook. MS Outlook does work well and the larger screen in a benefit for reading some messages. The ability to link your phone message system with the Chromebook is a significant plus; it is possible to do this on the iPad but it is awkward because of the lack of an app for some messaging platforms. The Chrome operating system is a generally well designed one once you get to know it but it pales in comparison with IOS. If I had it to do over I would purchase a low end PC even at about twice the cost.",3.0 out of 5 stars,David,29 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

B08NTP5RTN,Acer-Chromebook-Spin-311-CP311-2H-C7QD,It's better than Acer's support,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2023","I bought this to take with me on my trips rather than my heavier, more expensive laptop.  Up until today, I was really happy with it.  Today, I was testing the ability to connect with this device to the ASUS router at my house so I could upload pictures from my travels directly to my network.  The app, AICloud, works fine on my phone and other chromebook devices but, for some reason, my Acer Chromebook won't upload files.  It will let me access my USB drive and download files but attempts to upload fail every time.  I spent some time with Asus trying to identify the issue but since it works with other devices, they suggested it was an Acer issue, which seems pretty reasonable based on my 20+ years in the IT industry.Acer's first tier tech couldn't help beyond saying to call Asus, which is what I'd expect from Tier 1 support.  Once I persuaded them to pass me up the ladder, the tier 2 tech listened very attentively before saying this wasn't their problem and he was unable, or unwilling, to try to work with me on a solution.  In effect, the Acer team makes devices that are not compatible with apps obtained from the Google Play Store so, as the saying goes, ""Caveat Emptor"".For the record, I didn't rate Gaming because I don't play games on this device.  Maybe I should since it can't do really technical chores.",2.0 out of 5 stars,PvilleBob,,Verified Purchase,3,2

I was more so impressed with the physical condition of the laptop as I’ve seen and heard of many horror stories from others who have order refurbished MacBooks throughout. I received a clean and truly refurbished MacBook as described. There was only one minor imperfection which was a small scratch on the bottom that is hardly noticeable. Also some very fine and minor rough edges that is only noticeable if you were to look at it up close but that is expected with used product. The MacBook also came with a new charger. The battery life appears to be in normal condition and no issues so far. Keyboard, touchpad, touch bar, and screen functions work just fine, no issues.The only slight “con” I had was with setting up the computer. I assumed the seller set the laptop to its original factory setting as I was not able to perform certain functions initially due to having an outdated MacBook OS.

This laptop is surprisingly great with small games, I wanted to start playing games to pass the time and it runs the games as it should, maybe a little loud with the fan and battery may not last but I normally use it in clamshell mode anyway so the battery isn’t a horrible issue. I would say for around $450 it is great, I at first had a bit of issues with the space bar but after about an hour of typing and breaking it in it seems to have fixed the issue. When I first got it the battery was completely dead as expected but took around an hour to charge to a state of being able to use, the screen had no problems, it is amazing value, setting up the OS is simple and quick, the screen had no cracks, scratches, or anything wrong with it, and the laptop itself had a great overall appearance with no buffs or scratches to be seen.

B083JLH1Z9,Apple-MacBook-Pro-MPTT2LL-Renewed,Awesome refurbished MacBook Pro - Enjoying it by now.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2022","Despite I was hesitant to buy a refurbished MacBook Pro, adding that some buyers had a non favorable at all reviews when I was thinking to buy, I decided to try with this vendor Kanga and if any issue happens, to return it before the 90 days period.By now being the third day after ""unboxing"", the experience has been so pleasant, with the following highlights:1.- Speakers performs like sound bar systems, even better that some bars for TVs. I've been listening this morning a Pink Floyd concert in YouTube and i've found its flawless sound is amazing, much better than my 50 inches Smart TV.2.- It had MacOS Monterey preinstalled, and after a not so long update, I had the latest version 12.4, with all current patches.3.- It has a minor scratch on the back of the screen, and I won't see it when I put the case on the MacBook Pro, so I don't care too much of this. It looks and behave like new MacBook Pro, in a mint condition, despite it is at least 5 years old.4.- Coming from a MacBook Pro 2015, I'm getting used to the touch bar, however the learning curve has been no significant and I'm learning quickly its features. Touch Bar working fine at the moment.5.- Touch ID did follow its procedure to acquire my finger marks, so now its working fine too.6.- I believe those who mentioned bad experiences with their buys, however that is not my case until now.7.- I may think by a moment that I'm using a MacBook Pro with M1 Pro, without paying that hefty price. However when looking that the Apple support status it is out of warranty, so I'm coming back to the reality.8.- I found it required additional hardware to connect with my HDs with Thunderbolt for USB C, so having converters I did the first Time Machine backup with no issues.9.- Battery is above 90% capacity, with no cycles of use, so I understand the degradation may come because of the time and not by a previous use.I'm trying to use adding heavy workloads to the MacBook Pro in order to find any possible issue (like graphic card bugs), however at this moment the behavior is very good as expected.So I congratule Kanga to deliver this excellent device that I'm enjoying by now. However if something changes, I will update this review in the coming days, or to return it at the first failure.",5.0 out of 5 stars,David Ruiz Silva,28 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,2

I ordered the ""excellent"" refurbished item and it arrived fully functional and ready to update(which is required to be done by the buyer due to factory reset and this being an older computer) but something about the chasis sticker threw me off. The whole top and bottom of the macbook has had a sticker applied suspected to be used to hide scratches. Also even though ""excellent"" was the target theres still a chip in the casing along with the obvious sticker cover up job they did.(which should be advertized atleast) just that alone leaves this feeling like a dkoldies style ""refurbishment"" which leads me to beliee it definitly wasnt refurbished as a true refurbishment would require opening the device and cleaning/reapplying thermal paste(at the very least). with such a thin compact form factor this is very much needed part of refurbishment for this mac. Otherwise to these defects the mac performs and all functions it originally had are operational.

The only other option to the troubleshooting page was to return the computer. I have already loaded it with the software and tools I need and I need the machine now. Can't return it now. So I will live with the glitch. Another issue is the battery. It inconsistently charges and seems to hold a charge for a short time. The battery check option on the computer says ""Service recommended"" and it says the battery is consumable and may need to be replaced. Is this why it is resetting? The computer is plugged in when the reset occurs. Vendor, what solution is there other than returning the computer?",4.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Customer,,Verified Purchase,2,2

B083JLH1Z9,Apple-MacBook-Pro-MPTT2LL-Renewed,"So far, Great for the price!*UPDATED* battery poor quality&crashes","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2022","Apple 15in MacBook Pro, Retina, Touch Bar, 2.9GHz Intel Core i7 Quad Core, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Space Gray, MPTT2LL/A (Renewed) - I needed a new laptop for photo editing as the Ram on my Microsoft surface pro is not equipped enough for Lightroom/photoshop, everyone suggested a MacBook of some kind, but my bank account can't get on board with those steep prices of $1,500+ so when I found this refurbished one for $650 with the option for monthly payments, I couldn't pass it up! I have had it for about a week now and so far so good. It arrived faster than it was expected, the cosmetic damage to the laptop is okay, there is a large dent/gouge on one of the edges that is pretty significant. The rest appears mostly unscratched but that's because it appears to have a sticker across the entire front and back of the laptop to appear as though it is brand new. It looks fine, the only way I noticed was when I look at the bottom of the laptop I expected to find model #s so I could buy a compatible case for the laptop and there is nothing on the bottom of the laptop what so ever. When I saw that I looked at the edges and sure enough there is a sticker across the whole surface to cover any cosmetic damage. The A key on the keyboard sticks a bit from time to time, otherwise functionality, speed, and battery life have been good so far. The screen is REALLY REALLY sensitive to touch (changes color in the spot that anything brushes by it) so I worry the screen will break at some point in general transportation of the laptop. Even if I run my finger across it with no pressure, it reacts as if I'm pushing on the screen hard. I will update if anything changes!***UPDATE: the battery only lasts for 2 hours of use unplugged, it dies if it’s not being used either. And at least once a week it gives an error message stating that it unexpectedly restarted due to an issue. Not thrilled with the issues but I need the device.",3.0 out of 5 stars,User_CvineL,14 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,2,2

There’s a giant stain but I’m buying a skin regardless for this so I’m never going to see it after this. I installed Mac Fan Control for the fans and I keep it at a constant low and doesn’t make a sound.

B083JLH1Z9,Apple-MacBook-Pro-MPTT2LL-Renewed,This is a very much long overdue review...,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2023","I'm a photographer returning to work on a budget & was in great need of a new MacBook since my last one had a damaged screen.When I received this MacBook everything checked out okay. It came in great condition and operated fine. However, after a few days, it shut off on me without warning and kept giving me the signal of it needing to charge. I thought it was because the night before I accidentally left it on charge, which is something I try not to do.I tried two old charger cords that I had, as well as troubleshooting it as directed online, but it didn't work. When I contacted the seller they told me to try the same stuff that I saw online to troubleshoot. I also took it to a computer tech and he told me I would need a new MacBook. I tried again taking it to another computer tech and all it needed was a new charger cord and adapter. this cost me $130.Since then I've been having more issues with it.1. It has to be kept on charge to stay on.2. It sometimes shuts off on its own while on charge.3. The USB ports doesn't operate as it should. God forbids my laptop shuts off because the charger was accidentally disconnected or just shuts off on its own, I would have to keep trying the other ports for them to work or restart the computer and wait about 15 minutes for them to kick in.4. A few days ago, out of nowhere, the laptop or USB port had a glitch and completely formatted my SD Card with 2 recent photoshoots on it before I got the chance to transfer them over. Thank heavens I was able to get the photos back. I had to pay close to $90 to download a software that would allow me to access and  restore the deleted photos.I did contact the seller during the refund period, however, I live in Turks & Caicos where anything we order would not be delivered to our doors. We would have to have it sent to a friend's address and have them bring it over whenever they can or have it sent to a company's US address and then pay additional duties and freight on the items. Returning items are not easy and can be very costly. So, to return this MacBook & get the refund, I would have to go through one of the shipping company's and pay to have it sent over & then order a new one which takes time away from me getting work done and more than likely turn away clients. The seller did ask how much it would cost to have it sent over, but after considering the time frame I may be without a laptop and getting work done, I just stuck it out and trying to get the most out of what I paid for.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Earlsalena Robinson,18 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,2,2

Some of the keys ended up lifting off and the keyboard didn't feel solid. I tried to get it replaced under Apple's recall they put out, but I was a year too late.

Has a few cosmetic scratches, but no big deal. The description says it comes loaded with OS X Sierra, but it had Mojave instead. Didn't really matter because I upgraded to Monterey anyway. The drive is formatted in APFS, so that was no problem. It came with a power supply, but not the extension cable for the supply. Fortunately I have a spare and they're interchangeable.For some reason, the product page doesn't include a photo of the right side of the computer, so I'll tell you: it has two USB-C ports. The MacBook has a total of 4 of them. These are the only ports, so you'll probably want to buy an adapter for your thumb drives, data cards, HDMI cables and headphones.But I'm deducting one star because the computer arrived with a very dirty keyboard and screen.

It’s a long story but after some playing around, I got it to work so I could update it, then I had no issues.Not a huge deal, but I would say my biggest feedback would be to keep even the renewed devices up to date if your processes allow for that.

Well how am I supposed to remove the account if the product doesn't reliably turn on. Why on earth is this my problem now?Several hours on the phone with amazon later, several weeks into the process, and after several screw ups from amazon's returns team, I finally got an assurance on my refund for sending the item back.Its not enough really. Thats my time down the drain dealing with all this BS. These guys have a 3.8 rating on Amazon, that is TRASH, and it was my mistake for not heeding that.

I'll be doing basic web browsing and using non-intensive apps and the fans will just spin up and stay on the entire time. There may be dust build up inside or else there is another problem - maybe it has something to do with the latest macOS version running on the old hardware.After more extensive usage I realized just how spent the battery life is. The number of battery cycles exceeds 200, and it cannot hold a charge for more than 2 hours for basic file system tasks and browsing - practically just the screen being on.

I know this isn't new, but I am absolutely blown away at what $180 bought me.This thing is light, sleek and efficient. It plays 4k 60fps videos easily, both on youtube and VLC.I've been burning off a full charge since 6pm. It's 9pm right now and I'm still at 75% and I've been playing videos, browsing the web and installing apps since I started. This is insane.The unit looks practically brand new. The battery appears to be the original Dell-branded battery. It's clean, spotless.[EDIT] I did find one nickel-sized spot on the monitor where the colors are slightly faded. You can only tell on a plain solid-color background and only if it's a lighter color. My desktop is currently plain black and I can't tell. Even when it's noticeable, it's barely noticeable. [END EDIT]The only thing that was even a bit shady was the Windows 10 install. Today is 5/9/24. According to sysinfo, the install date is from 2019. I doubt this laptop has sat for 5 years. I have a feeling the seller just deleted the users and made a new one. There was no set up or Welcome to Windows like a fresh install.For me, this is completely irrelevant. It's getting a fresh install in a couple days. But you might care.This is beyond an incredible value. Anyone older than 40 will understand that computers 1/1000th of this power used to be $5000 (in 1980's dollars).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nick,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3

And I wasn't looking forward to trying to buy a replacement battery when I had just purchase this. I would suggest finding a laptop that has a removable battery, also I personally have not had good luck with refurbished items from Amazon. Speed and quality of the laptop itself were very decent.

B087YW8FQB,Lenovo-Chromebook-Processor-Graphics-82BA0003US,A Hidden Gem Among the Bargain Chromebooks,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2021","SUMMARYA surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASEHaving recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those ""laptop-y"" things... and an 11"" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.PRIME DAY HUNTINGWith those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other ""deals"" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.UNBOXING AND USEWhen the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.The trackpad works well and is consistent.Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALTBecause expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.Lenovo has been ""killing it"" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.",5.0 out of 5 stars,T. C. Perconti,577 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3
B087YW8FQB,Lenovo-Chromebook-Processor-Graphics-82BA0003US,"Simple, well rounded chromebook.","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2022","I got this computer for work. I needed something cheap and highly portable, and having used a chromebook in school I knew I wanted one. This chromebook is great for the price and needs I needed met. ChromeOS is a pretty smooth and well rounded system, and this particular laptop is sleek, thin, lightweight, and visually pleasing. It does have Linux built in, but I can't comment on that because I'm not the most tech savvy. The good thing about chromebooks is you don't really have to be.Keep in mind if you want a chromebook, most of the time the apps are meant for a phone or tablet. As far as I know, most games won't work or will be hard to play, and some apps have diminished usage because of how tapping vs. Clicking works. Not that big of a deal to me, but it could be frustrating to someone who wants a regular laptop for casual use. The touchpad on this particular one is pretty good, and large enough to use given the size of the laptop. The keys are a little thin and small so sometimes I miss them or mistype when going fast. The screen is perfectly acceptable, vibrant and it fills most of the bezel. Overall, 8/10.",5.0 out of 5 stars,art,22 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3
B087YW8FQB,Lenovo-Chromebook-Processor-Graphics-82BA0003US,You Really Can't Beat the Price,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2023","This is a cheap laptop, which is exactly why I bought it. I use it when I travel for work since it's really lightweight, and by running linux on it I can do anything I would need it to.The screen is blurry, and it can sometimes do a weird thing where it doesn't turn on while outside, but it gets the job done and is no frills. The built in chrome os has major training wheels but that may be desirable for some users.A note on running linux on this: your best bet is using Crouton to set up a chroot. This chromebook has a Gemini Lake processor, so trying to do anything more fancy like a dualboot or replacing the chromeos completely with linux or windows doesn't really work sadly.If you decide to go ahead with the chroot, my advice is to use a simple desktop like xfce if you run ubuntu. I tried to get unity working and you may have better luck (or skills xD) than me, but when I tried booting the initial setup never ran, and doing tricks like opening the terminal via a shortcut just didn't work.In short, though, it's a fun little computer and is really good for the purposes of travel.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bill,11 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3

The screen can be seen in about any lighting condition, direct sunlight is a little sketchy but still usable. The battery life (for me) is about 2 weeks, really depends on what I'm doing though. If I'm really using it for work and then come home to mess around on the internet I'll get about 10 hours sometimes 11 hours but that's really pushing it. The screen size is pretty nice it's only 11 inches but for what I really do on it I don't mind, if I need to do more I usually get on my 17 inch but for timesheets and excel this little thing is nice. Performance side of things this thing runs great, 99% of apps open in seconds. For the money this is a fantastic machine, perfect size for on the go, responds instantly, and lives all day or more in my case. The only thing I would say I don't like is that only 1 of the 2 USB C ports will charge it, would be nice if it would work either way.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Michael Blaker,7 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3

Is obviously damaged or defective internally. Same issue persists can't connect to internet except as a guest. Can't even bring up a Clipboard. Had to request a refund. Sending this junk back to Canada. So disappointed with this junk-Trash-garbage thing!!! Wanted so much to like it. My spouse purchased me another Fire instead of this junk! Can't recommend it. Perhaps, if you have perfect, fast internet, this may or may not work. Who knows. NO SUPPORT FROM LENOVO AT ALL!!!!!Feb 15,23 UPDATE: Love it as a gift BUT it really doesn't work to its full potential for me. Why? After nearly a month of trying to fix the same issue, nothing works. Except for ""Guest Browsing"" I can't really use it. I can't designate myself as the owner or the Administrator. I keep getting message that ""Network Isn't Available"" to ""Try another Network"" and ""Browse as a guest."" I can browse as a guest and use the internet without issues but I can't own my Chromebook so I can't download apps, games whatever. This item is a BIG disappointment. Yes, I tried troubleshooting, contacted Lenovo (no help) visited the Google and chromebook communities. Found others have same issue but there are no resolutions I can find. I've tried so many fixes that should work including Powerwashing it, shutting down /restarting my router to reset, shutting down my Chromebook, checking for updates and drivers, which there aren't. Sorry, but this is a bust. I preferred my Kindle Fire. My spouse is upset too and wishes she gave me something else. Who would have thought this would be junk? NO SUPPORT FROM LENOVO AT ALL!!!!!Original review Feb 02, 23: My spouse gave me this as a gift to replace my seven year old Kindle Fire which started freezing up. (She gave me that too!) First off, this is not so easy to set up. Especially when you're dealing with light service internet by AT&T. I can get on it as guest but I am not able to become the Chromebook's owner. Can't figure out how to set that up. Also, had to contact Lenovo to correct the purchase date. They had it down for October which shortened my warranty. Make sure you catch that.Looks nice. Very lightweight item. Works fine other than initial setup. We'll see how this works as time goes by. Attractive and overall easy to operate. Slim lined in operation. Aside from connection woes, I like it and highly recommend it.Overall, it's nice. I liked it at first. What else to say?

The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select ""view inbrowser"". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order.

I thought it was a Laptop… with Windows, like others. I couldn’t figure out there was a difference till I reviewed it on the internet. I read it’s not a Gaming PC, nor a Graphics capable computer! It has confused me seeing I have 3 other Laptops tho broken. When I first opened it I was almost disappointed! But I had gotten it just for writing. My PC and tablets can do gaming if desired. So, finding this out made me realize it is exactly what I wanted. I’m not interested in super speed, 4K graphics, or storage; I have 3 external drives or a terabyte of extra storage. What I did need was an extension of my Desktop computer. I wanted to share my office program and use MS WORD. It does all that! I wanted to have a way to take my Desktop on the run. I can with this unit. It’s very lightweight; almost too light to do what it does. It’s fast and sharp enough to view YouTube videos without lagging. The memory and internal storage is real small; 32Gb storage… My phone is 10 times faster, has 4K video, and 50 gigabytes of Cloud Storage. So like I said; “It’s exactly what I wanted!”The price was also what sold me… not to forget the pretty white color I chose. Is this worth the money? YES!Can you print with it?

B0BN6WNJVY,HP-15-Notebook-i3-1115G4-Windows,OK for the price,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2024","The media could not be loaded.                I’ve written to the Seller, let’s see if they respond, but the machine will not allow me to complete the setup process.  The trackpad requires multiple pushes to get it to register, so perhaps the laptop was damaged in transit.  As others have said, it was packaged very poorly- dropped loosely in a much larger box with nothing to keep it from banging around.  Neither the trackpad, the arrow keys, nor the touchscreen will allow me to scroll down to hit “accept” and continue the registration.  Very disappointing.  I will update this review if Customer Service makes things right.  UPDATE:  the seller immediately offered a return.  Meanwhile, I was able to get through the setup process on the 7th try.  I dont know what the glitch was or whether the machine or Windows 11 was at fault, but Im in now.  Also as others have said, the thing defaults to Windows Safe Mode- which is annoying, but can be switched through a little effort.  Im still not a fan of the trackpad, it seems to not always register clicks, and sometimes seems to click on its own!  but, the memory is good for a laptop at this price and it will do what I need it to do for work for the next few months, so I will keep it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Ryan L.

B0BN6WNJVY,HP-15-Notebook-i3-1115G4-Windows,Some tips on all negative reviews on S Mode and Battery...,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2024","So I bought two of these computers, one for my daughter and one for me. Let me say first that DURING your INITIAL setup make sure that you DO get properly signed in to your Microsoft account and your OneDrive account. Set them up during setup. Also make sure that one drive is set to sync. While setting up my daughter's computer I got the password wrong so it set it up without signing in. After setup I did sign into Microsoft and OneDrive but did not set it up to sync. I could not get that computer out of S Mode no matter what I did. I had to reinstall a brand new windows 11 and then go in and delete the old operating system in order to get it out of S Mode.On my computer setting it up I DID properly get signed into Microsoft account and one drive and told it to enable the sync. This one came right out of S Mode after the setup was done when I followed Microsoft's instructions. It must have something to do with enabling those things and signing in during setup and not afterward! (Microsoft should be CLEAR about this and nowhere did I find this information online - truly it was by accideny).As far as this complaining about a battery not holding charge. First of all your standby time unplugged I have at least 10 to 12 hours, if not a few days. I left mine unplugged overnight and it only went down less than 10%. If you're using your computer yeah you're only going to have maximum 3 to 4 hours of battery time and that's the same on all of my laptops. Secondly this computer comes with an HP interface program called MY HP that includes Diagnostics. You will have to create an account and sign in but there are diagnostic tools in there that will test your battery. One of the things HP says (Especiaaly with a new computer or if you are replacing a battery) is that you need to condition the battery so that it does not get damaged or operate improperly. What they recommend is that you discharge the battery until the computer shuts itself off. Then you plug it in (if it starts up when you plug it in let it boot and turn it back off all the way). Then allow the battery to charge with the computer off for a minimum of 6 hours. Then you unplug the charger and let the computer sit for at least 4 hours still completely off. Once you turn it back on reload the HP diagnostic software and run the battery test again. If it still tells you that the battery needs conditioned then you will repeat the process up to three times until it tells you the battery condition is good. Make sure when you do this that you have the power setting set to charge the battery to 100%. Once you have conditioned the battery go in and set it to power saving so that it only charges the battery up to 80% so that way you don't overuse the battery and you don't get Ghost charges. If you do this you will have a longer usage time and standby time. And you won't damage the battery in the end.",5.0 out of 5 stars,amy g.,21 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3

The laptop was working perfectly fine, and then today I got the black screen of death. We plugged it in, tried to reset it. Went through all of the trouble shooting steps and it didn’t turn back on. It makes the chiming sound like it wants to turn on, but then it just doesn’t. The keyboard lights don’t turn on, and the screen is just blacklit. I’m very saddened by this development. We have requested a refund. Hopefully the return will be smooth. Also when you print the return label you also get a letter that says that Kanga Supply reserves the right to charge you a 20% restocking fee if they find you returned the product that isn’t defective. They also say they’ll charge you “up to a 50% fee” if you don’t remove your account from the device and turn off find my Mac. Since my screen is black I have been unable to remove my account. Hopefully they don’t charge me 50% of $900 because the screen isn’t working and I can’t remove my account. 😭😭😭😭............I have wanted a MacBook for the longest time. But the price was just so much more than I have ever been willing to spend. But this year we finally decided to splurge on a MacBook. I was so happy to find this listing. I was able to get the larger storage size for cheaper than a brand new smaller storage MacBook. I was super worried about it being delivered. I was worried it would be damaged in transit. It was not. It was wrapped very nicely in a very thick bubble wrap. It arrived with 7% battery life and looks brand new. The battery has 80/1000 cycles used so it wasn’t used a lot. However since it is the intel chip and not the m1 the battery life isn’t excellent. I used zoom for about 1.5 hours and the battery dropped from 100% to about 70%. It’s not terrible but I would definitely recommend bringing the charger or a backup battery pack along with the MacBook. The shipping was excellent and it even arrived a day earlier than expected.

I've had the laptop for almost 4 months now and it works great! Battery life is decent- not worse or better than most laptops. I do wish the camera quality was better but it is a 2016 model. But it's not a deal breaker for me. We all know cameras on electronics have gotten way better within the last 6 years. The charger that came with the laptop was not the original charger. The charger fried while it was plugged into my husband's computer. Not sure what caused it but I can't say it was a good quality charger. Definitely an after market. Luckily it didnt damage his laptop or catch the house on fire. Otherwise, I've never had any issues with the laptop. The shipping came directly from the seller and I received the laptop within 24 hrs of purchase. I would buy from this seller again.

I work remote and use it on a daily basis. Because of that, I am returning it. Unfortunately, the video camera does not work. It freezes and lags. At first I thought it was the wifi but I tested the speed and it was great. I tried from multiple locations, house, library, hotel etc. Then my IT friend suggested I make sure all updates have been done. I spent SO LONG making sure to have everything installed properly. He also said it doesn’t look like it was wiped properly because there was stuff on it that shouldn’t be. Every time it turns on it says “Michigan Medicine” on the black screen. Weird. Anyways… after many tests, I pulled out my old laptop and ran ZOOM at the same time, side by side on the same network. My old laptop worked perfectly. We even downloaded Skype to see if it was a ZOOM or camera issue. Skype didn’t work either. I tried testing the camera from the settings and it was black (see photo) or it was a frozen image. We determined there is something wrong with the camera and I need to return it. I’m bummer because I like it otherwise. Everything else was great about it- the speed, design, ease. I’m not sure if I’ll risk it again and buy another refurbished laptop or just shell out the big money for a new one. Just wanted to post an honest review for those who are like me and actually read these things. I hope it’s helpful.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Jasmine,15 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3

B0BYK9SZB8,SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Business-Computer-Windows,This is a great laptop!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2024","I really do love this laptop, this thing got some power to it, I can easily connect my iPhone device to get text messages and calls directly from my laptop, it can run all my work application such as zoom and software I use without any issues.  I get a good 8 hours of battery life which is not terrible and it covers a full work day for me. The volume is loud in my opinion when watching YouTube videos or streaming in general, I tend to use my headphones most of the time and never actually use the laptop volume. I don’t have any slow loading issues, the webcam is 720 p and works fine for what I need it for. I use it daily in a call center and never run into any problems with it. I used a MacBook before I got this laptop and has all the bells and whistles that my old MacBook had. I highly recommend this product if you’re a student.Only downside to this device is it does not offer a backlit keyboard ): so working at night requires a light to be on, or if you’re like me and memorized the keys than it wouldn’t be a total deal breaker.Update: 6/26/24This laptop is still performing excellently after a few months of use. The battery life remains strong at 8 hours. I did purchase a higher quality webcam since Zoom calls were a bit spotty. All my devices connect without any issues. If you’re like me and need to connect multiple devices, I recommend investing in a hub, as the laptop offers only 2 USB-C ports, 2 USB ports, and 1 HDMI port.

No scratches or anything. The system started up and ran tasks quickly, touch screen worked great and image was beautiful. This next pro will be explained more in the cons. The return and refund process were painless and very fast. With a 90 day warranty period, the Amazon refurbished offering is low risk. )Just keep all the packaging in case you need it.)Cons: This system came already logged into Windows. I feel it should boot to the Windows setup screen and not already have an account which could have malware installed. I messed around with it for 10-15 minutes to check out the features and then it froze up, rebooting gave me a “Hard Drive not Installed” error. I rebooted to setup, and it worked again for 10 minutes. This was repeated for a while so I learned how to wipe windows with a fresh install. Once it was updated and through the setup I got about 30 minutes before the error occurred again. At that point I submitted my return request and packaged it up.Overall, while it worked it was great.

My needs are just for basic office functions and a few online board games via Steam, but I wanted something at least comparable to the laptop I bought in 2019. This easily fits the bill, and at a very decent price.FYI: Out of the box, Windows installed without a hitch and everything seemed to update on its own, but then I had issues with the graphics lagging at times and causing my (relatively basic) games to freeze and crash. However, this turned out to be a simple matter of manually updating the driver after all the other, automatic updates were installed, and took all of 2 minutes to fix. Now everything seems to work fabulously!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Geebs_in_NM,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3

B0BKFMXKKJ,HP-Stream-BrightView-Graphics-Bluetooth,From Apple to Windows - A Refreshing Change with a Few Notes!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2023","First off, I want to say that I am a diehard Apple user. This HP 2022 Stream 14"" is the first Windows product I've ventured into in a long while. My main motivation to switch things up was to see the contrast in user experience between a Windows laptop and an Apple one.One thing that definitely drew me to this laptop was the price tag. Unlike its Apple counterparts that can run into the thousands, this HP laptop was an affordable $319.00. That's incredible value for money!However, there was an immediate downside I noticed: the absence of a keyboard backlight. With my not-so-great eyesight, a backlight would have been a big help. Despite that, the laptop itself feels light, even more so with the protective case I added.In terms of battery life, I manage to squeeze out a good 4 hours, especially with tasks like schoolwork and Zoom meetings. As for the Windows system, it's taking some readjusting, but overall, the laptop has been holding up well. It's been a worthwhile shift, and I appreciate the balance of cost and functionality this HP offers.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kawena Lorenzo,127 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3

The keyboard is probably the best that I've ever used and is very solid. The build quality is astounding and very solid with no fear of something breaking, especially in the hinge category of the screen. No, it's not a one handed open but who wants a flimsy hinge anyways. This is more than adequate for students and anyone who desires a solid laptop for both home and school as well as business use. Games run as expected but it's not a high-end gaming device. However, this one delivers awesome performance with just the right amount of RAM and storage. It's not only light enough to carry around but also very responsive. Lenovo did a great job in the assembly and build quality and I can attest doing programming and video editing this unit fits the needs perfectly.

I use this as a second computer to do my writing when I'm not at home. The 8GB RAM is plenty for my needs. Although this isn't a gaming machine it plays some of my older games like Age of Empires and Diablo II. There are a few downsides though. The hard drive is tiny but I bought an external hard drive for less than upgrading the storage. It would be nice if the USB ports were on the right side instead of the left. And the function keys are a little off. You have to press the Fn keys to get them to work instead of things like the volume keys.

B0C6NNH7VQ,HP-Business-Display-i3-1125G4-Processor,Be Careful What You Buy,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","SOME WORDS TO THE WISE. Overall, I'm satisfied with these HP17x laptops. BUT!!! There are a couple things to be WELL AWARE of, before buying. First, and FOREMOST. A word of caution! As most everyone knows, Microsoft has, for quite some time, been transitioning truly from a software company into a retail sales company. That fact is abundantly clear! Now, be well aware of what Microsoft has done in its latest versions of WIN11-HOME. Many (perhaps most???, perhaps all???) Windows11-HOME based computers are delivered with the OS in ""S-Mode."" We run HP desktop and laptop computers exclusively, so I can speak only to my several more recent HP purchases. However, I no longer subscribe to WIN11-HOME. All of my recent purchases have been ordered with the WIN11-PRO OS. My advice to those considering buying any computer preloaded with WIN11-HOME: ""stay well away."" ""S-Mode"", does not allow the user to load any 3rd-party software. All software must be obtained (think $$$$$) from the MS Store. While MS claims that the procedure required to exit ""S-Mode"" is quite simple, in fact, we've found that it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE!!! And, it will require the involvement of MS 'off-shore' tech assistance, which is not necessarily easily obtained. One such call that I received, after HOURS of waiting, arrived at 2AM. If buying an HP17x laptop, order with WIN11-PRO. PRO versions are not restricted by ""S-Mode"" software. Now, to the computer. Typical of HP products, this laptop is well built, with an excellent display. Ports are somewhat limited, but, for me, that is not a deal-breaker. I like having the 32GB of RAM, and at least 1TB of storage. I expect these laptops to be more than adequate into the foreseeable future. My one complaint with these, and it is critical, is that the integral cooling system is WHOLLY inadequate. When used for long periods of time, especially on mains power, which we do, these computers will run HOT!!! My take on that is, putting an engineer and an accountant together, on any design project, inevitably results in trouble. In an effort to make this laptop as slim and as light-weight as possible, the internal cooling apparatus has suffered for it. In these, the CPU does generate a lot of heat. The air duct is quite small and narrow, and the internal fan is a joke, except that it's not. So!!! Buy a serious laptop cooler, to go along with your laptop purchase. And, I don't mean one of those multi-fan, USB powered units, that generate heat to remove heat. High quality, AC/DC-adapter powered gaming type coolers are available from Amazon. You'll be happy you made the purchase. At first, battery life is quite short, but we've seen that over time (repeated charge/discharge cycles) battery life does improve some. In our case, having to use mains powered coolers, we simply use mains power for our laptops, and we don't rely much on battery power. Of course, bear in mind that having to have access to AC power does diminish the practicability of using a laptop computer, in the first place. The HP17x series are big computers with a healthy display. One minor complaint is the lack of a backlit keyboard. But, for the money (around $500), these were still a good buy.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jeff Hitchens,95 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3

Back it goes to the 'Log in with a Microsoft Account' screen every time.No choice, I had to log in with a MS account.In the course of trying to change to a local account, the UAC kicked in and stopped me from clicking to change any setting, install anything or do anything at all.After five solid hours of searching for a solution and finding images and descriptions of options that were not on this machine. I gave up, put it back in the box and returned it.It's worth a restocking fee to get rid of this thing.As for Windows 11: if I want 3 different desktops, widgets that push MSN, icons thrown in the middle bottom of the screen, and a system that blocks me from doing anything I want or need to do with it, I'll get a Mac.UPDATE: The seller refunded the Full amount. (I did pack it up exactly as I received it). Thank you!",1.0 out of 5 stars,Jeanie,29 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3
B0C6NNH7VQ,HP-Business-Display-i3-1125G4-Processor,"Large screen, short battery life, charger gets way too hot","Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2024","This is my first HP. I decided to go with it when replacing my Dell due to price vs features.I like this laptop because it has a much larger monitor and the keyboard is full size.What I don’t like about it is that I always gotta be charging, the battery life is only about 2 hours even optimized. And the charger is of poor quality. It gets extremely hot.While I do like some of the features it’s not enough to make me a repeat customer of HP and will likely go back to Dell in the future when I need to replace.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cassie,5 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3

B0C6NNH7VQ,HP-Business-Display-i3-1125G4-Processor,Not a slam dunk,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2024","Received the product on-time and undamaged. Good start. However, no real instructions included. On startup (which was an adventure since they moved the Start button to a demure key on the keyboard), the screen locked up, and you could do nothing except reboot, try again, get same thing. My son, who is far more experienced and schooled in PC's than I am, eventually broke through and got the basic setup done. I am very disappointed to learn that evidently my new pc does NOT have backlighting for the keyboard. Since my old (8-10 yrs old) pc did have keyboard backlighting, I mistakenly ASSUMEd the new one would have such a basic feature. Evidently it does not. Since there is no clear documentation (at least not found by me) of it's features, I have been left to Help screens and YouTube videos to learn about my new pc, neither of which speak very specifically. I did get the RAM I wanted, so we will probably settle in comfortably in due time. Oh, and it didn't come with a mouse, which I thought rather strange. Problem solved by Amazon in less than 24 hrs. Too bad I can't order keyboard backlighting the same way. Will have to live with that forever.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Customer,,Verified Purchase,1,3

The process went smoothly, and I love the large screen. However, I am slightly disappointed because I thought it was a touchscreen, which was definitely disappointing. It becomes even more confusing when you are asked to leave a review about the touchscreen. Can someone clarify if this is supposed to be a touchscreen or not? Additionally, the sound is not very loud at all, which is a bit of a letdown. Especially when traveling and wanting to watch a movie from your laptop, you won't get great sound. I'm not sure if there is an alternative to try to amplify the sound more or if I should consider getting another computer.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jessica,,Verified Purchase,1,3
B095CZJQYN,Dell-Latitude-5400-Non-Touch-Refurbished,Dell Latitude 5400 Business Laptop: A Reliable and High-Performing Choice,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2023","I recently purchased the Dell Latitude 5400 Business Laptop with a 14-inch FHD Non-Touch display for my mother-in-law, and I am thoroughly impressed with its quality and performance. This laptop has proven to be an excellent choice for everyday use, combining reliability, performance, and ease of use.The first thing to note is the Full HD 1920 x 1080 resolution display. The screen offers crisp and clear visuals, making it perfect for both work and entertainment. The non-touch aspect of the screen does not detract from the experience, as the clarity and brightness of the display are exceptional.In terms of performance, the Dell Latitude 5400 stands out. It handles everyday tasks with ease, be it web browsing, working on documents, or streaming media. The laptop runs smoothly, and I haven’t noticed any lag or slowdown, even with multiple applications open. This is a testament to its robust processing power and efficient memory management.The build quality of the laptop is another highlight. It feels sturdy and well-constructed, which is reassuring, especially considering it is being used by my mother-in-law who appreciates simplicity and durability in technology. The design is sleek and professional, making it a good fit for both business and personal use.One of the aspects I appreciate most is the laptop's user-friendliness. It is straightforward to set up and use, which is important as it is intended for my mother-in-law, who prefers uncomplicated technology. The interface is intuitive, and navigating through Windows 10 is a breeze.Battery life is also commendable. It lasts long enough to get through a significant part of the day without needing a recharge, which adds to its convenience, especially for someone who may not always be close to a power outlet.In conclusion, the Dell Latitude 5400 Business Laptop is a fantastic choice for anyone seeking a reliable and high-performing laptop. Its combination of a clear FHD display, solid performance, robust build quality, and user-friendly experience makes it a valuable device for both work and leisure. I am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it to others looking for a dependable laptop.",5.0 out of 5 stars,B. Jones,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3

Nothing flashy just a robust easy to use laptop for around the $200 mark.Pro and Con time. Pros: Runs an Intel i5 8th gen processor that is more than enough for what I need at home. Upgradeable. I added more memory when I got it, I went from 16GB to 32GB and the 500GB SSD is fast (less than a minute for boot up time).Cons: The cooling fan and battery are know to go bad but are easy to replace and cheap and the age is starting to creep up.Summary:Overall a great machine for the money and my usage. Parts are cheap and not hard to replace.  A must buy for a 2nd computer for travel or around the house. It's not that expensive so if it's lost or broke you're not out a lot of money.",5.0 out of 5 stars,AfghanVet5,,Verified Purchase,1,3

B0C6VVL3ZM,Lenovo-IdeaPad-Touchscreen-i5-1155G7-Windows,"Great Computer, Good Experience With Seller","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","The computer came quickly and works like a charm. Had to adjust settings to get the most out of the battery, the default settings=2 hours of battery life, but with a quick google search I found how to turn off certain background apps and switch from the default ""intelligent cooling mode"" to ""battery saver"" using the Levono vantage app as opposed to the systems own power settings.  The laptop is fast and efficient for school and can handle older games like Fallout New Vegas like a charm. I bought the touch version for the IPS, 300 nit screen because I did not want to settle for a tn display at 250 nits that you see in some over Levono models. I don't use the touch features, but the display is decent and bright enough for what I need it for.  All in all, I have no regrets about buying this model.  With all that said, make sure this is the model you want. Returning this due to buyer's remorse comes with a hefty restocking fee. It's not an item you can just return for the heck of it because of Amazons overly lenient return policy. (It really is, I used to work as a Customer Service Supervisor at Whole Foods and after Amazon acquired us, I went from supervising a team of cashiers to doing hundreds of Amazon returns a day. Hard to say we were a green company with all the packaging waste we went through on a daily basis).

Gave it to her, and started setting it up. That's when I got the same problem that a lot of people have mentioned in reviews.It would not recognize my Wi-Fi network. It would not recognize my mobile hotspot. It does not have a physical ethernet port to connect a hardline. The Network connection screen does not have an option to bypass if you do not have internet connection.I had to contact Lenovo support. They had me open command prompt to re-run the initial Windows setup in a manner that would allow me to select ""I do not have internet"" in order to bypass that step.But it got worse. The laptop would not even allow me to turn on or off WiFi... because it came with a bad Network Adapter installed. The tech support agent at one point told me I could just return the laptop for a replacement, but eventually got me to lenovo's support page on a different computer where I was able to download an updated Network Adapter driver to a USB, and transfer that to the new laptop.I might update my review depending on how the laptop performs, but based on the setup process- it's a nightmare",3.0 out of 5 stars,B.

B0BVD8LZQL,HP-Display-i3-1215U-Graphics-15-dy5599nr,fan is driving me crazy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2023","i'm not sure if i got a defective laptop, but i'm running into quite a few issues with it. the fan is on about 70% of the time, even when i only have a couple amazon tabs open or when i just turn it on. i keep checking task manager and it's showing cpu and/or memory spikes up to 98% for no apparent reason. it happened a couple times while writing this review. i had to take a photo with my phone because the snip tool wouldn't open while this is happening.most of the usage is coming from microsoft edge browser. i've done many google searches and tried many different combinations of settings both on msedge and the laptop itself, including performance and efficiency settings, but nothing helps. i've even tried using different browsers from the microsoft store but still same issue. i want to use the laptop, but i always end up putting it away because i can't stand the nearly constant fan.there's also a fast clicking/ticking noise from the top/right edge of the keyboard, especially when i open a new program or browser tab. i googled this and it says the hard drive could be failing. one time, i left the laptop open and it was constantly making the ticking noise until i closed it. also, i can also hear a faint static noise from the same spot on the keyboard, and it ramps up when i use the touchpad.i saw another review that said youtube plays fine on this laptop, but mine is constantly dropping frames (even with hardware acceleration on. without it, it drops lots more). i've never had a laptop do any of this before, and i really wasn't expecting it for $311.there was a few times where the laptop started lagging so much that typing was in slow motion, then it wouldn't respond to any inputs so i had to leave it to resolve itself. also, the battery drains unnecessarily fast, in my opinion.i've downloaded and installed all the latest updates and the laptop is still in S mode. if amazon or the manufacturer could assist, i'd greatly appreciate it. i didn't want to go through the hassle of a return, but the laptop is unusable in this condition.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Justin,,Verified Purchase,1,3

Once this was complete started migrating software from old laptop.Got interrupted so shut down new ASUS until later. Upon trying to boot up to continue - no display on ASUS laptop. After several attempts to boot up and then trying the hard boot process as per the ASUS tech support web site; initiated live chat with ASUS.After various suggestions ASUS requested that I connect an external monitor. Now I don't carry an inventory of spare parts around so had to cobble up a connection to a 55"" tv located in another room. Running back and forth to keep the diagnostic going  ASUS timed out the chat session twice so I had to keep reconnecting and asking new ""chatter"" to reference back to previous session to avoid having keep repeating myself.Got external monitor up and was instructed to perform a system reset. First time nothing happened, still displayed on external monitor. Second time may have done something because now even external display doesn't work. Can't see anything. Can only assume my personal software got erased with system reset but cannot verify. ASUS chat then said stated unit needed to be sent in for repair.No way am I going to endure the time delay and aggravation of going through the repair process on a new machine so I have returned and found a non-ASUS unit.This is the first, and last ASUS device I have purchased.

B09BSKP98T,HP-Notebook-Celeron-Processor-Microsoft,HP Laptop - Refund,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2023","I started setting up this computer in August 23. Daily issues.  HP support has handled many problems.  I have multiple devices and  the only problem is the HP Surface computer.  I've been through Microsoft, Windows windows 11, Goggle, Amazon. Seeking a solution.  The problem appears to now be only Amazon.  If I'm in Amazon shopping I have to watch my screen constantly.  Example: Amazon open on computer,  while searching, I see someone has taken control of the mouse..  The cursor moves to Gift Cards $1000.  I immediately shut the computer down. I received a text a week ago saying Amazon had canceled my Prime account due to the suspicious activity.  Which caused me to change  4 other credit cards.  I saw today on the items list, 2 things I did not look at.  The air flyer and $1000 gift card.  I caught both in progress and  shut the computer down.  I've reloaded the app, changed password already.  I purchased this in early August,  yet my warranty says 4/24.  Early on I contacted the seller.  Who was not able to help with another problem.  HP after 4 calls I spoke with the Technical Lead.  That was a new issue with windows 11.  The number pad couldn't be used.  I've tried looking for a  Amazon Support number,  with no success.  After the keyboard issue, I gave this HP a good rating.  That dropped steady to now (2) Its under warranty and I want a refund. I don't have hours to be on the phone with support.  Two months ago I gave a technical support lady from I believe the buyer, access.  The issue was corrected.  No one uses this machine or has my personal information.

B08ZLF99VD,ASUS-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Processor-C433TA-AS384T,I love my chromebook! Just a couple caveats,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2023","I've owned chromebook for 10 months now and I just love it! Here's some updates after using if for awhile:1) Screen flickering: this is a problem but not long term. Also, if you just close the computer and reopen it, the screen will stop flickering.2) Battery life: very long, and it only takes me about 35 minutes to get a full recharge. This hasn't been a problem for me!What I don't like:-Keyboard lighting: the keyboard is so easy to use and works well. But the blacklisting is not bright and the silver keys with white letters makes it difficult to see the letters...unless yours in a dark place 🤔The keyboard is my biggest pet peeve but if yourve memorized your keys/placements you'll be fine. I just wish they had done black ink on the letters of thr keyboard so they were really clear and seen well.Another pet peeve:Chrome books are difficult to connect to printers. Most home printers are compatible with Apple or PC computers. My printer had a hard time connecting via wifi. It never quite worked. I'm going to get a different printer.Everything else I love...Including the compatibility with Goole products, but even non Google apps or products connect well with it.

I feel hampered as I've only ever used Microsoft type computers and being elderly may have slowed my learning speed.I will try to update this review as time goes by.My old laptop was extremely slow and I was looking for something different and speedy.First impressions after having a Chromebook for 1 week:-It is FAST.  Pages load really fast!-It was easy to transfer all my data & settings from my old computer, thanks to using Chrome in past years.All my photos are there.  The Chromebook shows you how and guides the process.-The keyboard lighting CAN be brightened to improve key visibility.  This was one of my big concerns as many reviews mention it.  The key were hard to see due to the low lighting at first.  I didn't find a reference to it on the Chromebook at first and needed a quick fix.  A search on Google showed me how.  I followed the instructions and now I can see the keys very well in normal household lighting.-It is a learning curve to learn the keyboard shortcuts.  I am jotting down notes in a notebook.-There is a Chromebook simulator for learning.-It has a easy, sensitive touchscreen.-Screen brightness is easy to adjust.-No detectable heat output.-Battery lasts a long time.-Tablet mode:  Open it completely until the two outside surfaces touch and it is completely flat.  The touchscreen is quite responsive.- Any questions I have regarding how to use this Chromebook can be easily answered by a quick Google search.- The screen comes on instantly when opening, if I don't turn the Chromebook off.  Navigation icons are at the bottom of the screen.Still learning; will update.",5.0 out of 5 stars,CAD,86 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3

B08ZLF99VD,ASUS-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Processor-C433TA-AS384T,Great computer for the price,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2021","If you want a laptop with a nice-sized screen, 360 rotation, and touchscreen it's a great laptop at a great price. I've had mine for 3 months now with no issues. I use it for college and a charge lasts me all day until I get back to my dorm. If I don't use it much over the weekend say an hour a day then a full charge will last all weekend. The only downside is that the touch screen is capacitive and not active. If you want to write a lot of notes on your laptop and you can spare another hundred or so get the C436 it has an active screen. My notes are really sloppy and it's not the easiest but it works fine and I only use it in lectures to make annotations on pdfs and then take notes on paper when I get back to my dorm. I wouldn't use it for notes all the time because of that. But for the price it's the best all around for what it offers.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Danielle Willenborg,14 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3
B08ZLF99VD,ASUS-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Processor-C433TA-AS384T,The keyboard is NOT useless!!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2022",I got this for use at work as we got new ePCR software and were handed iPADS without physical keyboards and I just couldn't do it. That being said.. I use it at home also! This machine has turned out to be a great overall device. The display is nice and bright. It's fast.. and the battery life will last well into 2 days in a single charge! The fact that it starts up in seconds is a plus as I can do what I need to do and shut it completely down and be back up in a moment's notice. The keyboard took some getting used to.I have seen folks mentioning that the keyboard being backlit being useless especially during the day as the contrast makes the markers on the keys nonexistent. I've seen that there are lots of folks who haven't been able to turn the brightness down or even off. I have your solution.. using the alt key plus the up or down brightness key will turn it up or all the way off. I have found this to be quite useful as the only complaint that I have had thus far is this problem. But no more! Alt key plus the brightness key (up or down depending on what you're after) and you're good! I'm using it all the way off right now with only the screen brightness being just fine. The screen is halfway up. Give that a try before you seek to write it off as useless. I hope this has helped!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Matthew,73 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3
B08ZLF99VD,ASUS-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Processor-C433TA-AS384T,STOPPED WORKING- HAVEN'T HAD IT 2 MONTHS,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2023","I received this laptop on January 4,2023, and by February 18,2023 it stopped working. It doesn't come on and it doesn't charge. Right before it went I out, I had just looked at the battery percentage which was at 57%. I tried contacting the seller, and got no response. But before contacting the seller, I contacted ASUS and the warranty on the laptop expired last year, so there was nothing that they could do about it. This was labeled as being new and I really think that it was refurbished. I contacted Amazon and they informed me that it was unable to be returned because it was past the return window. I waited 2 days for the seller to respond. Because I don't want a refund, I would just like for the laptop to be exchanged for one that actually works. I ended up contacting Amazon again, and they were able to provide me with a full refund, but will be charged a restocking fee, which they promised will be refunded once the item is received. If I knew that this laptop would come with no warranty/expired warranty and that the seller would do NOTHING to help, I would've never purchased this laptop. I was able to have this resolved due to Amazon-NOT THE SELLER!

B08ZLF99VD,ASUS-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Processor-C433TA-AS384T,Tried Chromebook instead of Laptop--BIG Mistake!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2022","I'm a senior lady who is 71 years old.  I have used computers my whole adult life.  When I ordered this Chromebook instead of my usual purchases in the past of Laptops, I did so by reading what the differences were between the two, then I spoke with my son-in-law about the differences and got the impression that there was not that much difference.  I just received my Chromebook four days ago.  I was surprised at how nice it was.  Very heavy to me at first, compared to all other Laptops I've used, but as I'm using it, it does not fall off my lap when I move a little!  I am going to keep this in mind when I find the right Laptop for me. This Chromebook in my opinion, is one of great quality!  Quite solid and sturdy!  I have two favorite things on this Chromebook.  One is the screen!  It is so clear, very colorful, easy to read. It is the BEST SCREEN I have ever used!  The Touch Screen is more precise when using it as a laptop.  For example, ones I have used in the past, have always been difficult to select the exact spot where you want the cursor to be!  I would need to select, go back, select again, go back, the line, the letter, the number.  I don't know if it's due to the clarity of the screen or if it's programming, but not having to constantly select and re-select over and over again, is a blessing!  The fact in which you can fold this  screen over and work on it as a tablet is great!  What I don't necessarily like is how ""touchy"" it is.  When I folded it over and started using it as a tablet, My hands, in holding it to use as tablet, kept touching the on/off button on the side.I would touch the enter keys and shift keys and kept ending up somewhere that I didn't want to be!  This Chromebook said one of the features was a ""backlit keyboard"".  If it is, it is a very poor one! I could see somelighting underneath the keys, but the letters and numbers on the keys do not light up with this!  What good is some lighting underneath if it doesn't light up the actual letters/numbers?  I'm also frustrated with this Chromebook that the keyboard is too simple!  With a Laptop, I could switch between screens I had opened by using the Alt Key with the Tab key. Not on Chromebook!  If I wanted to type a word fully in caps, I just had to touch the Shift Key. Not on Chromebook!For those who learned and worked on a Chromebook in the past, I believe this would be a good one to try,really feels very solid and sturdy.  For me, I'm going to be returning this one and keep researching for the best inexpensive Laptop I can get. I will be sending it back for a refund and keep looking for the Laptop I'm use to.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Frances Rathmanner,29 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3
B08ZLF99VD,ASUS-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Processor-C433TA-AS384T,"Stylus WORTHLESS, Chrome Operating System flawed - keyboard backlight weak","Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2022","Ok, I realized going in that Chrome was oftentimes complained about and that this is a Chrome machine.  I am not saying that Chrome is a crummy system, in fact, I find this computer runs Chrome fast and with very few hiccups.  The problem is Chrome will not do many things I have come to expect from Windows or MS DOS [or whatever it’s now called].  It is fast and every halfway normal operation can be accomplished.  But problems do arise. For example, I can put my own photo in as wallpaper for the opening menu but I can’t manipulate it.  My photo was too large for the screen and that couldn’t be adjusted.  I had to use their supplied pictures.  Not a big deal, but that ability was something I expected and was stunned when the program refused to do it.  There are several other “what’s going on “ moments, but I think you get the idea.This machine is fast.  I surfed the web with no problems, looked all over Amazon, read books with numerous graphs and complex pictures, and looked over a few of my own photos without difficulty.  The ASUS did load Google Documents and Documents then loaded my document files from the iCloud in nothing flat.  To augment the internal memory I added a 256 gb microchip which was instantly recognized; however, I had to jump through some hoops when I realized nothing was being saved or moved to the chip.  I found the needed adjustment in settings and I was moving ahead again.  I really enjoy being able to add memory to the computer with a chip.  I think this is a major advantage over machines that don’t have this capability.The machine does have a few problems that might be considered deal killers to other people. First, the keyboard is not good. It is difficult to type on and this resulted in numerous corrections having to be made. I have actually purchased another keyboard from logitech that hooks up to this computer by Bluetooth. Once this keyboard was successfully paired I was able to begin typing on what I consider to be a standard keyboard and many of my errors disappeared. I think the keyboard is a big problem with this computer. The backlight on the keyboard is almost useless. I will note that when the back light is at a low setting it is extremely difficult to see the keys.  You can increase the brightness by pressing the alt key and then pressing the increase brightness key on the function keys across the top. The keyboard will increase substantially in brightness; however, I find that even at the brightest setting the keyboard is difficult to see. It may work well in low light conditions, but in a room with regular light it is still difficult to ascertain which key is which.  An experience typist will not find this a problem, but to people like me I think it is a substantial problem.On the keyboard there is no caps lock. Why this was omitted is confusing. I find that using the caps lock is a constant undertaking. To achieve capitals the operator must press down the alt key and the little magnifying glass key then the machine will lock on cabs.The weight of the computer is nothing to sneeze at. While the number of pounds seems small, try holding it out at arms length for more than 10 seconds and you will quickly see the weight is a necessary consideration.In my opinion, the screen is sharp and easy to read.  For more demanding screen details you will have to go up in price.  Viewing movies isn’t a problem, in fact it looks quite nice.I have saved the worst for last.  This particular computer from ASUS does not, stress not, have a good stylus associated with it. I bought a stylus from Amazon and had to be especially careful to use the exact number for this computer because there are other models very near in number to this model and styluses that work with other models will not work with this computer. The stylus I bought does not allow one to draw on this computer. The stylus badly lags when used for drawing, and the stylus is not accurate in placing the line. This may be the computer itself and not the stylus; however, this lack of ability to accurately use a stylus is nearly a deal killer for me. I am very used to using the Apple iPad Pro 12.5 inch. Not being able to use a stylus is almost incomprehensible to me at this stage of computer development.  Having this  ASUS computer only work with a very few highly specific styluses is most disappointing.  It took me over a week to start looking for a stylus to pair with this machine. Had I known the limited availability of styluses, and the nearly usable nature of a stylus with this particular machine, I would not have purchased this laptop computer. I really enjoy drawing, and drawing on the iPad is one of my favorite hobbies. I was looking forward to being able to sketch on this ASUS computer, but I find this is impossible with this particular machine. It is unfortunate the previous reviews I read did not mention the difficulty in pairing a stylus with this computer and the horrible nature of the resulting stylus lines if a person attempted to draw.  Amazon’s return policy on computers prevents me from returning this machine. I suppose I could trade this in somewhere and try again, but that would be quite expensive. The next machine will avoid Chrome and will definitely either come with a stylus or have a good stylus readily available. A machine that I cannot draw on is an anathema to me.AD2",2.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Dale Daniel,54 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3
B08ZLF99VD,ASUS-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Processor-C433TA-AS384T,Works Well ...But...,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2024","There are a number of things I don't like. 1. It does not sit flat on a flat surface. The hinges lift the device.2. It is difficult to open. I added a pair of small silicone dots to make it easier to get a nail under the lid. I used thicker rubber bumpers to lift the device so the hinges can work without lifting the device. 3. The keys are difficult to see as the letters are against a silver, not black background. I have a black lettered skin which helps...but defeats the key light and must be taken off when lit keys are useful.  Its end of use life is only 2029.

Why wouldn't you? I mean, my previous Chromebook was an even older model from Asus and it easily gave me 10-12 hours on a single charge.Not so with this device. You're lucky if you get 3 or 4.Finally, the keyboard backlight automatically engages upon booting up. This isn't something which can be customized in settings, and it generally makes the letters highly illegible.

B08VKT45K4,Acer-A515-56-36UT-Display-i3-1115G4-Processor,Great little machine at a ridiculously low price!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2021","I figured 4GB of RAM would be sufficient just for day to day use. I was a bit disappointed in 128GB of storage and decided that even though it was a really nice machine for the price, for another $80 and change I could really make it fly.. if you look at my photos you can see that there's built in space for a 2.5 in SATA drive. In addition there is room to add memory and I decided to add another 8GB of RAM along with the SATA drive and 480 GB of storage. Obviously it makes a huge difference. If you look at the pictures I posted you can see that the Acer storage is depleted by half as soon as you turn the machine on. The Steve drive is the one that I installed. Plenty of storage now. The circled in red photo shows the increase in RAM... WHEN LOOKING FOR INSTRUCTIONS be aware that this model came out back in May of this year. There are very few instructional videos or written pieces to explain where this memory goes. The SATA drive is pretty self-explanatory. The only video I could find with this particular machine is provided by a user whose name is.   @Silicon Edge   you have to go to YouTube and search that name. I don't believe Amazon would allow me to post a link. It's not in English but all you have to do is watch his hands. If you try other videos you might think it's the machine you've bought until you open the back of yours and you look at the back of theirs and realize that it's different. I highly recommend temporarily taking out the screw on your right side of the battery to secure the ribbon clip. Then just readjust the battery and put the screw back in. Watch the video you'll know exactly what I mean. I love this computer. For $460 including the new ram I upgraded this machine. It would have cost me way more than that to buy it with that memory and that storage from scratch. Quick PS. I bought an HP 27 inch monitor here on Amazon and created a nice little setup. $169. You'll love the machine Don't think twice just buy it. If you want some speed, I mean real speed just upgrade the RAM and the storage. I used crucial. That's the brand name for the SATA and the RAM..... READ ABOUT THE UPGRADES..... You don't want to perform Overkill. The processor wasn't made for it. I'm no techie so I did a lot of reading before I did this.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Steve,276 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3
B08VKT45K4,Acer-A515-56-36UT-Display-i3-1115G4-Processor,Great Performance with Slight Screen Glare,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2023","Title: Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-36UT: Great Performance with Slight Screen GlareI recently got my hands on the Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-36UT, and overall, I've been quite satisfied with its performance. Here's my detailed review:The laptop boasts a 15.6"" Full HD display, providing sharp and clear visuals that make multimedia content and work tasks enjoyable. Powered by the 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 processor, it handles everyday tasks with ease, ensuring smooth multitasking and responsive performance. The 4GB DDR4 RAM and 128GB NVMe SSD provide adequate storage space and quick data access.One notable feature is the inclusion of WiFi 6, which guarantees a fast and reliable internet connection. This is especially beneficial for those who heavily rely on online activities like streaming, video conferences, and browsing.However, it's worth mentioning that I did notice some screen glare on the laptop. In well-lit environments, particularly areas with bright overhead lighting or sunlight, there can be a slight reflection on the screen. While it didn't significantly hinder my overall experience, it's something to consider, especially if you frequently work in brightly lit spaces or are sensitive to screen glare.In terms of build quality, the Acer Aspire 5 is sturdy and well-constructed. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the trackpad is responsive and accurate. The laptop's slim design and lightweight nature make it easily portable, adding to its convenience.Regarding software, the Acer Aspire 5 comes with Windows 11 Home (S Mode) pre-installed, providing a streamlined and secure user experience.To summarize, the Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-36UT offers great performance and features. While there is a slight issue with screen glare in bright environments, it doesn't overshadow its overall capabilities. If you're in need of a reliable and efficient laptop for your daily tasks, this model is definitely worth considering.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Mimi Adams,6 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3

B08VKT45K4,Acer-A515-56-36UT-Display-i3-1115G4-Processor,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2022","Wanted to get a relatively cheap laptop with a 1080p screen that could do mainly basic functions like watching videos from various streaming services (Youtube/Twitch/Netflix) in Chrome. This POS can't even do that properly. RAM runs at 100% while idle because 4gb is barely enough for just the operating system to function, and just having chrome open is enough to push the CPU to 100% as well, so doing nearly anything is extremely slow. Screen is 1080p but the quality is not great. I don't know what super geniuses thought to put the cooling fan in front of the keyboard instead of on the side, but it makes it sound like a tornado whenever it is doing anything at all, even idling. Oh and also if this thing is anywhere near you while you are sleeping, be ready for the fans to rev up to max randomly, out of nowhere, while it's in sleep mode and wake you up, for no reason. Sound is also very quiet, you need to crank it up to 50/60 to hear pretty much anything.I haven't bought a laptop in a few years and I thought even cheap laptops would be able to deliver on basic functionality, but boy was I wrong. I still think the Acer Aspire 5 is a decent laptop line, just not this model.

B08VKT45K4,Acer-A515-56-36UT-Display-i3-1115G4-Processor,"Fine laptop, suits my needs perfectly but I did add memory to it.","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2021","I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this laptop. It seemed like a good computer for the price. Many if the reviews said it was short on memory. It has a SSD drive but it is a bit on the small side, and the built in ram was lacking at only 4 gb. There is an open slot for ram and a space for a second hard drive already there. The company included a pack of hard drive screws with a web site to instruct you on how to install a second drive. Since I had a like new 1tb laptop drive and a 8gb memory card laying around, I waisted no time. The upgrade was simple.Honestly, I have no complaints with this laptop. Some people complained about the screen. I don't know why, it's very clear to me. Battery life is fine, but I am just a home user so I am not on it for hours at a time. The speakers point down from under the computer, but I can still hear what I need to so no big deal to me. I even don't mind the touch pad on this one (hated the one on my last computer).If you are a gamer or someone who needs a super powerful computer for intense graphics, this probably isn't your best choice. But for home use, I am very happy with this laptop and would certainly recommend it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mike Sumpter,62 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,3

So, I'll put up with having to adjust the screen so I won't get a picture that looks like a negative, and the way that the opening screen when I use my Chrome browser is sometimes really small and has to be stretched out before I can use it. I'll use earphones to hear dialog on some movies because it doesn't do well picking up very low-volume sounds, like whispers.What drives me crazy is clicking on something, and then having things go screwy because sometimes my cursor is just a cursor-image and the actual cursor has moved elsewhere, like the upper left corner of the screen, or gets hung up some where until I release it for a few seconds, or like just now, playing a game, I click on a certain area, and I get sent to the exit page, even though I didn't want the exit page, and the area I clicked is nowhere near the area you click to exit. I tried re-starting the game, but it didn't help, I tried moving to another part of the touchpad, didn't work. I can't play the game if I can't access what I'm clicking on.

B08VKT45K4,Acer-A515-56-36UT-Display-i3-1115G4-Processor,Refund issues after twice returning same product,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2022","Purchased Acer laptop after a treasure truck alert for @ $300. The first one bluescreened after about a week of use. Restored to factory settings then updated and it blue screened a second time. I contacted Amazon and requested a replacement which was done very quickly. Received a replacement laptop and it again just after 2 days of use bluescreened again. I again per its instructions reset to factory specs, updated again and again... it blue screened. So that normally means there's a flaw with the equipment. This time I requested a refund for that laptop and just chose a much better laptop which costed much more. I promptly return the laptop, got the confirmation it had been returned in the system per Amazon. Unfortunately Acer has not yet updated the refund request after at least 2-3 weeks that it had been received back in and checked. I also have not received any correspondence from Acer of the status of this issue. So be veeerry careful about that particular Acer laptop and the customer service issues with Acer. I've purchased Acer products previously without any issues and the replacement equipment I again purchased an Acer which I've had no issues with. But this isnt a very comforting response I'm getting from Acer's customer service.**Updated 05/09/22** After I reached out to an Amazon representative they immediately offered a full refund.

Windows said there were no audio devices installed. Whether I plugged in my external USB speaker, USB headphones, or just used the laptop speaker it told me the same thing. I reinstalled and tried different drivers but nothing fixed it... until I installed Windows 10. Now everything works great. Hopefully the next Windows 11 update will fix the problem.UPDATE: I decided that being stuck on Windows 10 with no more updates wasn't a good idea. After contacting Acer tech support they had me send them the laptop for repairs. I just got it back and all they did was reinstall Windows 11. That worked until I ran Windows Update and downloaded the latest Windows updates. Now I'm back to the same problem!! Is the solution to not get updates?

Setting up email on this thing was a nightmare and it really cannot handle office 360. I think the issue is this computer us but made to run Windows 11.  This when I went back to reset the computer to factory settings the computer went into an infinity loop of death.  The computer is a useless paperweight that uses up electricity and gets warm.  It might be a fire hazard.  Called customer service x2.  Did not get much help.  Even when they finally said they’d send out a slip to mail it back to fix it, I never got anything in my email on it or by postal mail.

B0C58BK83M,acer-15-Chromebook-Processor-Ultra-Fast,Acer Chromebook 315-Like Brand New!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2024","Wow, wow and wow! I am so very elated with my purchase or a renewed Acer Chromebook 315-15 inch screen. I was so very skeptical about purchasing a renewed Chromebook. My previous Acer 315 (exact same) died after almost 3 years. I was not going to get another of the same, but by comparison it still seemed the best value. I grew so used to the large screen and even the funny keyboard layout (with the ten-key numbers on the right which I don't really use) where everything is shifted more to the left, that it feels weird to type on anything else.This Chromebook looks brand new and I would swear it must be. Perfect condition. No scratches, dents, dirt, etc. The keys are not faded. Even the intel and Acer stickers look brand new. I truly cannot believe this is renewed!  It came with a case and charger. Be forewarned though, when you first turn it on and plug in the charger it will be at 0%. But that is enough to get you going. You will not see the battery icon on the lower right panel until it begins charging, so be patient! I also get the warning that it may charge slow because it's not the correct adapter, but again that went away once it began to charge. It said it would take 9 hours from 1% but again, it went superfast to 100% in under 2 hours. I ran the diagnostics and it shows the battery life is new, never before fully recharged or recycled. Wow, just wow....that is truly awesome as Amazons description said it would be maybe 80%.Set up was super easy, about 4 steps that you just click through. One thing I love about Google is that it stores your credentials so you just need your email and it's done. All my tabs, extensions and bookmarks came right back. I tested the sound and Bluetooth both are perfect! WiFi is super-fast and I honestly cannot say enough good things about this Chromebook. Kudos to the company and techs that refurbished it. They did an outstanding job. My other Chromebook was the exact same except it was 2000. This one is 2023 and I saved over $100 getting a refurb. Also my old one listed the screen at 15.6, but I measure both and each is exactly 15 inches. This Chromebook is also a little lighter but still made with metal and not plastic.In conclusion, I know some people have had bad experiences with refurb items especially computers, but I have to say this was the best first time experience for me. It all felt brand new like when I bought my previous one-- and in fact even better with some not so obvious upgrades in three years time, but definitely a faster more efficient processor and comparable but lighter weight parts/materials. I think it depends a lot on the company. If they have good integrity, morals and ethics they will not sell or ship faulty products. Again, hats off to the company and employees. Thank you! I highly recommend this Chromebook from you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rapture Me,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,4

Just a couple caveats,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2023","I've owned chromebook for 10 months now and I just love it! Here's some updates after using if for awhile:1) Screen flickering: this is a problem but not long term. Also, if you just close the computer and reopen it, the screen will stop flickering.2) Battery life: very long, and it only takes me about 35 minutes to get a full recharge. This hasn't been a problem for me!What I don't like:-Keyboard lighting: the keyboard is so easy to use and works well. But the blacklisting is not bright and the silver keys with white letters makes it difficult to see the letters...unless yours in a dark place 🤔The keyboard is my biggest pet peeve but if yourve memorized your keys/placements you'll be fine. I just wish they had done black ink on the letters of thr keyboard so they were really clear and seen well.Another pet peeve:Chrome books are difficult to connect to printers. Most home printers are compatible with Apple or PC computers. My printer had a hard time connecting via wifi. It never quite worked. I'm going to get a different printer.Everything else I love...Including the compatibility with Goole products, but even non Google apps or products connect well with it.

Pages load really fast!-It was easy to transfer all my data & settings from my old computer, thanks to using Chrome in past years.All my photos are there.  The Chromebook shows you how and guides the process.-The keyboard lighting CAN be brightened to improve key visibility.  This was one of my big concerns as many reviews mention it.

B08ZLF99VD,ASUS-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Processor-C433TA-AS384T,The keyboard is NOT useless!!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2022",I got this for use at work as we got new ePCR software and were handed iPADS without physical keyboards and I just couldn't do it. That being said.. I use it at home also! This machine has turned out to be a great overall device. The display is nice and bright. It's fast.. and the battery life will last well into 2 days in a single charge! The fact that it starts up in seconds is a plus as I can do what I need to do and shut it completely down and be back up in a moment's notice. The keyboard took some getting used to.I have seen folks mentioning that the keyboard being backlit being useless especially during the day as the contrast makes the markers on the keys nonexistent. I've seen that there are lots of folks who haven't been able to turn the brightness down or even off. I have your solution.. using the alt key plus the up or down brightness key will turn it up or all the way off. I have found this to be quite useful as the only complaint that I have had thus far is this problem. But no more! Alt key plus the brightness key (up or down depending on what you're after) and you're good! I'm using it all the way off right now with only the screen brightness being just fine.

B08ZLF99VD,ASUS-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Processor-C433TA-AS384T,STOPPED WORKING- HAVEN'T HAD IT 2 MONTHS,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2023","I received this laptop on January 4,2023, and by February 18,2023 it stopped working. It doesn't come on and it doesn't charge. Right before it went I out, I had just looked at the battery percentage which was at 57%. I tried contacting the seller, and got no response. But before contacting the seller, I contacted ASUS and the warranty on the laptop expired last year, so there was nothing that they could do about it. This was labeled as being new and I really think that it was refurbished. I contacted Amazon and they informed me that it was unable to be returned because it was past the return window. I waited 2 days for the seller to respond. Because I don't want a refund, I would just like for the laptop to be exchanged for one that actually works. I ended up contacting Amazon again, and they were able to provide me with a full refund, but will be charged a restocking fee, which they promised will be refunded once the item is received. If I knew that this laptop would come with no warranty/expired warranty and that the seller would do NOTHING to help, I would've never purchased this laptop.

B08ZLF99VD,ASUS-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Processor-C433TA-AS384T,Tried Chromebook instead of Laptop--BIG Mistake!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2022","I'm a senior lady who is 71 years old.  I have used computers my whole adult life.  When I ordered this Chromebook instead of my usual purchases in the past of Laptops, I did so by reading what the differences were between the two, then I spoke with my son-in-law about the differences and got the impression that there was not that much difference.  I just received my Chromebook four days ago.  I was surprised at how nice it was.  Very heavy to me at first, compared to all other Laptops I've used, but as I'm using it, it does not fall off my lap when I move a little!  I am going to keep this in mind when I find the right Laptop for me. This Chromebook in my opinion, is one of great quality!  Quite solid and sturdy!  I have two favorite things on this Chromebook.  One is the screen!  It is so clear, very colorful, easy to read. It is the BEST SCREEN I have ever used!  The Touch Screen is more precise when using it as a laptop.  For example, ones I have used in the past, have always been difficult to select the exact spot where you want the cursor to be!  I would need to select, go back, select again, go back, the line, the letter, the number.  I don't know if it's due to the clarity of the screen or if it's programming, but not having to constantly select and re-select over and over again, is a blessing!  The fact in which you can fold this  screen over and work on it as a tablet is great!  What I don't necessarily like is how ""touchy"" it is.  When I folded it over and started using it as a tablet, My hands, in holding it to use as tablet, kept touching the on/off button on the side.I would touch the enter keys and shift keys and kept ending up somewhere that I didn't want to be!  This Chromebook said one of the features was a ""backlit keyboard"".  If it is, it is a very poor one! I could see somelighting underneath the keys, but the letters and numbers on the keys do not light up with this!  What good is some lighting underneath if it doesn't light up the actual letters/numbers?  I'm also frustrated with this Chromebook that the keyboard is too simple!  With a Laptop, I could switch between screens I had opened by using the Alt Key with the Tab key. Not on Chromebook!  If I wanted to type a word fully in caps, I just had to touch the Shift Key. Not on Chromebook!For those who learned and worked on a Chromebook in the past, I believe this would be a good one to try,really feels very solid and sturdy.  For me, I'm going to be returning this one and keep researching for the best inexpensive Laptop I can get. I will be sending it back for a refund and keep looking for the Laptop I'm use to.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Frances Rathmanner,29 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,4
B08ZLF99VD,ASUS-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Processor-C433TA-AS384T,"Stylus WORTHLESS, Chrome Operating System flawed - keyboard backlight weak","Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2022","Ok, I realized going in that Chrome was oftentimes complained about and that this is a Chrome machine.  I am not saying that Chrome is a crummy system, in fact, I find this computer runs Chrome fast and with very few hiccups.  The problem is Chrome will not do many things I have come to expect from Windows or MS DOS [or whatever it’s now called].  It is fast and every halfway normal operation can be accomplished.  But problems do arise. For example, I can put my own photo in as wallpaper for the opening menu but I can’t manipulate it.  My photo was too large for the screen and that couldn’t be adjusted.  I had to use their supplied pictures.  Not a big deal, but that ability was something I expected and was stunned when the program refused to do it.  There are several other “what’s going on “ moments, but I think you get the idea.This machine is fast.  I surfed the web with no problems, looked all over Amazon, read books with numerous graphs and complex pictures, and looked over a few of my own photos without difficulty.  The ASUS did load Google Documents and Documents then loaded my document files from the iCloud in nothing flat.  To augment the internal memory I added a 256 gb microchip which was instantly recognized; however, I had to jump through some hoops when I realized nothing was being saved or moved to the chip.  I found the needed adjustment in settings and I was moving ahead again.  I really enjoy being able to add memory to the computer with a chip.  I think this is a major advantage over machines that don’t have this capability.The machine does have a few problems that might be considered deal killers to other people. First, the keyboard is not good. It is difficult to type on and this resulted in numerous corrections having to be made. I have actually purchased another keyboard from logitech that hooks up to this computer by Bluetooth. Once this keyboard was successfully paired I was able to begin typing on what I consider to be a standard keyboard and many of my errors disappeared. I think the keyboard is a big problem with this computer. The backlight on the keyboard is almost useless. I will note that when the back light is at a low setting it is extremely difficult to see the keys.  You can increase the brightness by pressing the alt key and then pressing the increase brightness key on the function keys across the top. The keyboard will increase substantially in brightness; however, I find that even at the brightest setting the keyboard is difficult to see. It may work well in low light conditions, but in a room with regular light it is still difficult to ascertain which key is which.  An experience typist will not find this a problem, but to people like me I think it is a substantial problem.On the keyboard there is no caps lock. Why this was omitted is confusing. I find that using the caps lock is a constant undertaking. To achieve capitals the operator must press down the alt key and the little magnifying glass key then the machine will lock on cabs.The weight of the computer is nothing to sneeze at. While the number of pounds seems small, try holding it out at arms length for more than 10 seconds and you will quickly see the weight is a necessary consideration.In my opinion, the screen is sharp and easy to read.  For more demanding screen details you will have to go up in price.  Viewing movies isn’t a problem, in fact it looks quite nice.I have saved the worst for last.  This particular computer from ASUS does not, stress not, have a good stylus associated with it. I bought a stylus from Amazon and had to be especially careful to use the exact number for this computer because there are other models very near in number to this model and styluses that work with other models will not work with this computer. The stylus I bought does not allow one to draw on this computer. The stylus badly lags when used for drawing, and the stylus is not accurate in placing the line. This may be the computer itself and not the stylus; however, this lack of ability to accurately use a stylus is nearly a deal killer for me. I am very used to using the Apple iPad Pro 12.5 inch. Not being able to use a stylus is almost incomprehensible to me at this stage of computer development.  Having this  ASUS computer only work with a very few highly specific styluses is most disappointing.  It took me over a week to start looking for a stylus to pair with this machine. Had I known the limited availability of styluses, and the nearly usable nature of a stylus with this particular machine, I would not have purchased this laptop computer. I really enjoy drawing, and drawing on the iPad is one of my favorite hobbies. I was looking forward to being able to sketch on this ASUS computer, but I find this is impossible with this particular machine. It is unfortunate the previous reviews I read did not mention the difficulty in pairing a stylus with this computer and the horrible nature of the resulting stylus lines if a person attempted to draw.  Amazon’s return policy on computers prevents me from returning this machine. I suppose I could trade this in somewhere and try again, but that would be quite expensive. The next machine will avoid Chrome and will definitely either come with a stylus or have a good stylus readily available. A machine that I cannot draw on is an anathema to me.AD2",2.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Dale Daniel,54 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,4

It does not sit flat on a flat surface. The hinges lift the device.2. It is difficult to open. I added a pair of small silicone dots to make it easier to get a nail under the lid. I used thicker rubber bumpers to lift the device so the hinges can work without lifting the device. 3. The keys are difficult to see as the letters are against a silver, not black background. I have a black lettered skin which helps...but defeats the key light and must be taken off when lit keys are useful.  Its end of use life is only 2029.

Received in good condition.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2021","This Device Was recieved on Monday March 5,2021, as promised. This new unit, booted up right away after putting in my SSID and Password. A word of advise make sure you use caps when needed. This review is being completed on my new HP Chromebook now seemingly fully functional. Please forgive my spelling errors as this is the first time using this device and the shortcuts, I have yet to learn. The reason this Chomebook is my chorse for now, is that google says all work is in the cloud and therefore reduces viruses, on that we shall see. Another reason is that the battery life is reported as being 13 hours of continuous use, again we shaal see. As of now I have no complaints. However expect an update soon.UPDATE.....Tuesday April 26, 2022I have been using this Chromebook for a year and feel that this is an investment that was well worth every penny that I spendAll that was promised has been achieved. I have experienced what this unit can do. I am glad of my choice. The battery life on my Chromebook is great. When you close the lid it shuts down and saves the battery with almost no battery drain until you reopen and your work is still there waiting for you. You can login to any wifi but you should have a good VPN to protect you ass you travel. 😘",5.0 out of 5 stars,C. Brown,11 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,4

Much better than my Acer. The screen is a good size and the screen quality is better too. The keyboard has a nice lay out. Not too much room on the sides for empty space. The touchscreen is a lot nicer than I expected, too! I’ve already gotten used to it. I would say this is definitely worth the buy! My first laptop was an Acer and even after having it sent back and repaired for a charging issue, I got it back in even worse shape. Wouldn’t load anything, lagged all the time, bad sound system. And lately it won’t turn on unless I reset it. And even then it doesn’t work. This is my first HP laptop and it’s great so far! Absolutely love it.

B08529LPLZ,HP-Chromebook-14-inch-Touchscreen-14a-na0030nr,Nice laptop - Crashes Modems/Routers with no fix,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2021","Pros: Nice build and feel, great speakers, simple setup, great valueCons: Within a few minutes of connecting to my wifi, it killed the internet connections to all other devices including its own connection. We have a rather common modem/router, the Arris panoramic models you get on rental from Comcast or Cox, in the west.After working with Amazon and then HP support, it became evident the issue is a modem driver within the computer needing to be updated. HP support claimed it was a known issue with my router/modem -- yet they didn't troubleshoot it and didn't ask which manufacturer/model device I had. In theory, the problem (a driver) is fixable..... if you can get the driver downloaded and added to the computer. In this case, this chromebook does not have an ethernet port -- so there's no actual way to install the driver and address the problem without loading it on a USB drive, downloaded from another computer, or sending in the computer for repair.Summary: You may have a modem or router that doesn't conflict or have a driver issue and be perfectly fine. I wasn't able to experience much beyond the handful of minutes it would be connected. However, there's no way to know in advance if you will encounter this problem or not. If you're willing to risk it and have the time to a) work with support or find/load the driver yourself, and/or b) return the device (stick to the 30 day window), then proceed with caution. Otherwise, I recommend passing on this and going with something else.For reference, in our situation we ended up going with a Lenovo C340 Chromebook for just a little bit more money with a better processor, more RAM, bigger screen (a flipable touchscreen). My router/model and internet connection have been fine with the Lenovo.",1.0 out of 5 stars,KP,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,4

GMAIL is messy and Google Drive is inferior to OneDrive and I don't like that Google made me have a Gmail account, etc.Until I learn more, I still prefer Microsoft OS and products.  But I do like the Chromebook for it quick boot up, size etc.  The ACER 311 with touch screen, etc is nice.  The ability to fold it backwards into a tablet is a worthy feature although I don't use it that way often.  But I don't like the fact that as a tablet it rests on the keyboard.The battery life is good - at least all day or more - and it recharges quickly.  When I take it to work I have a power cable in my bag, but have never had to use it.I wish it had a second USB-A port and an SD card port, but I bought a multi-port expansion hub that, although a bit inconvenient, meets my needs.A good device for the price.  I have two of them: one stays at home and the other one travels.

Other than that, I haven't encountered any problems with it yet. The touchscreen feature also works well. Highly recommended.UPDATE: I've had the Chromebook for almost three weeks now and today the screen suddenly froze leaving all keys and the pointer inoperable. Turning the power on and off had no effect.

As a renewed item, it is nearly perfect, with only the tiniest nick where you don't see it.  The machine specs exceed it's predecessor by a healthy margin, the screen is bigger in a very similar body size, and the performance is great!Being a business machine, it lacks a micro-SD slot, but it does come with a fingerprint sensor which works nicely to log in with. The keyboard is fabulous, the touchscreen is beautiful, and the touchpad perfect.  And the sound is WOW for volume and clarity.  And they put the power key on the left edge where it belongs, and NOT on the keyboard where the delete key belongs.The charger is just weird - a black box with a 4 foot long fat wire attached to the middle of one edge and another slightly less fat 4 foot wire coming out at the middle of the opposite side.  Not sleek or easy to pack up.  Wouldn't have been a design I'd be really proud to create,  but it works and charges quickly.  Charging is USB PD -I think 65 watts.This machine was a great value, coming in at 1/3 the cost of my last machine.

B08H1BS4D7,HP-EliteBook-x360-G6-Touchscreen,Two nonfunctional ones  in a row,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2023","I was excited about this computer because of the low price and the good specs. It didn't bother me that it was refurbished because I have had descent success with refurbished in the past.The FIRST ONE I had a NON-FUNCTIONING CAMERA. When we were setting up the computer for face recognition, all it showed was snow where the picture was supposed to be. We confirmed it by going into the camera program and it also showed snow and no picture. The computer also had a large dent on the front corner where it had obviously been dropped hard. Not exactly what I would call ""excellent condition"". We contacted Amazon (5 stars for Amazon for their customer service) for a replacement and they gave us a pre-paid return shipping label and shipped a new one. Really painless.The SECOND ONE that we received had a column of KEYS THAT DIDN'T WORK (8ik,). This is a common way that laptop keyboards fail. At that point, it seemed obvious to me that the company selling these computers has some QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES. These are not hard to find issues if they had actually checked the computers. I don't mind testing computers (I've done all things computers for many years), but I shouldn't be somebody else's free tester.I decided to get a refund and go elsewhere. But the seller sent me a POSTAGE REQUIRED shipping label. I had two bad computers sold to me. I should not have to pay the shipping for the company's mistake! I tried multiple times for two days to call the company to try to resolve this, but the PHONE WAS ALWAYS BUSY. That doesn't give me a lot of confidence in this company. They are either overwhelmed with customer complaints or don't have good customer service. In the end, I ended up paying to send it back.I'M NOT BUYING AGAIN from this company. In my opinion, you are better off doing what I did and paying $100 more to buy it from Best Buy where the quality control is better.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Sam,5 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,4

The screen is a force to be reckoned with.. I haven't had to turn it up past the lowest setting unless using it during the day at work. This machine handles tasks well.. even multitasking. Very fast and efficient laptop. If anything changes I will update this review.Update, 01/21/2023:  I must say that after a few days of this little guy being a daily driver I am nothing short of amazed. Perhaps I could feel this way because I've used a chromebook for the past two years and a Dell Latitude 7404 before that with an old intel core i5 w/8gb of ram running windows 10 pro? All I really do is Media/music/simple web browsing, occasional shopping and cloud based EMS software/apps for work and am the polar opposite of a ""power user"" who plays games and does host of other high demand things.. but nevertheless, for those activities that I engage in with my trust sidekick here, it has been a world of difference from what I am used to. I'm still learning the layout of Windows 11 (it upgraded for free the day after I purchased this laptop) but have not had a bad experience or any trouble yet. Very much worth it at this point. As far as I'm concerned, for my little world, worth its weight in gold! As always.. I will update with any more good news and/or mishaps. God bless..  :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Matthew,4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,4

I try to duplicate what students have on hand so I can best replicate their usage environment.  The Samsung CB actually worked too well.  It performed better than some of the devices I was seeking to replicate.  Response to the applications prompts was quick and screen resolution was sharp and displayed the assessment content clearly.  The accommodations components, visual enhancements and the text to speech reader were excellent and performed very well.  Outside of the QA work, this device streamed Internet content very well and the audio was clear.  Access to and performance of Google Apps and O365 Apps did very well and I found no issues.  The audio jack can handle headphones/mic combo. Battery life was good as well, lasting over 6 hours of continual pounding and high end development use.  This is my 2nd Samsung CB.

I didn't blare any music or drop my laptop or anything either so it's incredibly frustrating that it seemingly just broke out of nowhere.The actual functionality of this laptop is great. Compared to my old one that ran like a snail this works incredibly fast. The number pad being on the mouse pad is really neat. I use it occasionally.

B0979PC8DJ,Dell-Latitude-5414-Rugged-14,"Minor issues, but clean and working","Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2023","These rugged Latitude 5414s are in good working order.  I bought two of them for field employees.  ONE out of two had some minor scratches and blemishes, but barely noticeable.  They came preloaded with Windows 10, but the software used to load and parititon were not recognizable to me.  Also, it was the 1903 version so outdated and unsupported.  So I opted to reload everything with a base copy of Win10 22H2.  Everything loaded fine.  Had to change the BIOS to load from external USB in EUFI mode.  No big deal there.  Screens were clean and scratch free.  All keyboard keys and touch pads were very clean and in working order.  Touch screen works great.The only other thing is that I am guessing one of these motherboards must have been replaced during the ""renewing"" process.  Upon reload, one of the laptops automatically activated its Windows digital license, whereas the other did not have one.  So I had to purchase an OEM Win10 key to activate the second one (not a big expense).  Othe than the issues mentioned above, everything works great.All is as described in the description.  I would buy from them again.",5.0 out of 5 stars,JamesE,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,4
B0979PC8DJ,Dell-Latitude-5414-Rugged-14,dropping my rating,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","Update - Been a few weeks since I first used the laptop but today I wanted to install some additional software.  It's a BUST, B and N keys no longer work.  So, this laptop worked for approximately four hours and now, unless I can figure how to get the B and N keys to work, it's a door stop.Up front I wanted to say it's my fault.  I was looking for a small rugged Windows computer to use with a few mechanic programs - mainly ForScan.  Since I would take it while traveling it had to be tough, resistant to dust, not too heavy, and a screen I could see in sunlight.  This Dell has almost all of my needs - it is definitely tough.  It has dust ports covering everything.  It appears the battery and perhaps HHD are also accessible from each side.  I'm guessing it's the battery and HHD but with no manual, I could be wrong.  I used the Dell for the first time yesterday and after an long setup time; not blaming the Dell but trying to get through Windows caused me to reboot the laptop three times when Microsoft froze.  After setup and some personal software installed, I used the Dell on battery for about 90-mins without issue.  Sitting in my truck with the sun beating in, I was able to read the screen and that was a good thing.  My only issue and it's my fault, is the Dell is larger than I was expecting.  Of course it is heavy - given it's design and construction that wasn't a surprise and since it's in my truck 90% of the time or on my work bench, I don't think the weight will be a problem.  So, after just 48-hrs of use, we are happy.  Getting ready for a four month overlanding adventure and the Dell is going along, so we'll see if I need to update my review.",1.0 out of 5 stars,bluesy,,Verified Purchase,1,4

B0979PC8DJ,Dell-Latitude-5414-Rugged-14,I'd like to say...,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2022","I want to say I love this, but I don't know if I do. Only the laptop in the box, no charge on the laptop and no charging cord to turn it on. Maybe I'm crazy to assume that should come in the box with the laptop. I'll search for a charging cord and maybe, just maybe amazon forgot to include it and they'll overnight it to me. On the positive side it's well built, my HP was held together with gorilla glue and my 4 month old Dell cracked on the screen and it's held together with clamps so I opted for a rugged Dell and already I'm disappointed. Maybe we should bring manufacturing back to America to get quality item. That foreign stuff ain't impressing me much.  ""UPDATE""- I contacted the company and they sent my cord right out, I bought this because my new laptop case fell apart at 3 months old, this rugged case should last and last. It doesn't have 10 key, but I can live with that. Laptop is functioning well and it's very sturdy so I am very happy now.

B0C43M8CFX,Ruzava-Celeron-Cooling-Support-Study-Purple,"Fully compatible with Linux, serves as Pi-hole DNS server and backup PC","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023","Besides my new, bold red laptop, there were a few items inside the box. I found a small, black wired USB mouse, a white charging adapter, a clear, washable keyboard protector and a short user manual.The laptop is thin and weighs below 4 pounds. It has four rubberized feet in each corner at the bottom side that slightly elevate it, so air can circulate beneath. The keyboard is red as well with white characters, has a keypad and many functions have to be called with the Fn button. However, it does have its own Volume control buttons. What I miss is lights for the keys. Yet, it has three indicator lights right above the keyboard on the left for Power On, Caps Lock and Num Lock.The touchpad is large and has a different tone of red. It makes a click sound when I press on it. It supports multThe 16 inch display has a resolution of 1920×1200. Its aspect ratio is 16:10, which is slightly wider than 16:9 but it’s a difference I can notice, especially when I’m working with office apps. I can tilt the screen up to 180 degrees. I find the colors are displayed accurately and lively. I can set the brightness with my keyboard or through the operating system.There are seven ports in total. On the right side are three ports: one USB 3.0, one headphone jack, on SD card slot. What I find curious is that there’s a small rectangular opening. I thought that would be another port but I couldn’t find any reference in the user manual. Yet, in the listing itself I could find a picture that labels it as lock but I could not find any more information on how to use that lock and what it actually locks. Maybe somebody can tell. Anyway, on the left side, there are four ports: again one USB 3.0, DC power, HDMI, and a type C USB port.On the bottom, I have quick access to the 512 GB SSD and HDD bay. With quick access I mean I don’t have to open up the whole laptop. I just have to unscrew to screws to remove the cover of the SSD; the same goes for the HDD bay.That said, I added a 2.5 inch 320 GB Seagate Hard Drive to the laptop and installed Debian 12 Bookworm. The installation of the second operating system went through without errors and I could boot into my new Linux OS in seconds. I encountered no hardware compatibility issues.By the way, secure boot was off by default and I haven’t changed anything in the BIOS which has been released by AMI on March 29, 2023.I also booted into the pre-installed OS, which is Windows 11. The first boot took long because I had to go through the first time setup and in the beginning, browsing wasn’t fast because Windows downloaded tons of updates. Yet, after the update, web browsing got back to normal.When I opened the task manager, I checked the performance tab and indeed, the laptop has 12 GB installed. However, what baffled me was that task manager listed open RAM slots. So, I opened up the command prompt and issued the following command: wmic memphysical get MaxCapacity. That told me the maximum RAM capacity the laptop can handle. I don’t remember the exact number but it was over 12 GB. So, I decided to open up the laptop to just find out there were no empty memory slots and the pre-installed memory is soldered together. In short, no way to add more RAM. Still, the RAM is decent enough for daily work. It’s 12 GB DDR4 SDRAM at 2400 Mhz.When I opened up the laptop, I could also see that it has a 38 watts battery. Fully charged, the battery lasts me slightly over six hours with a few applications open and viewing a few videos.The processor is an Intel Celeron Processor N5095 that was released in the first quarter of 2021 according to Intel’s website. I can do basic tasks like web browsing, email, office like powerpoint with it. It has four cores and can boost up to 2.9 GHz, which is enough power for most everyday tasks.When it comes to sound, the audio is ok as there are two speakers for stereo. However, I prefer to use my headset as I like to listen to songs at high volume. The built-in microphone captures sound clearly but I often end up using my headset’s mic but in either case, I can’t tell much difference. Recordings from both sound almost identical.The webcam’s resolution is ok but my face appears paler than in real life and movements show up slightly delayed. It’s also not compatible with Windows Hello’s face unlock feature. However, I don’t care as I will primarily use the laptop with Debian and rarely, if ever, use Windows.The laptop also has Bluetooth 4.2. I could pair it to my soundbar that I mainly use for my smart TV. I didn’t encounter any delays.I was able to connect my laptop to my home network using both 5G and 2.4G Wi-Fi. Even though it does not have an Ethernet port built-in, it instantly detected my USB-C hub with Ethernet. This is important to me because I use the laptop as a private Pi-hole DNS server. A Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker that blocks ads on all devices on my home network.A wired connection is important for a Pi-hole DNS server because it provides a more reliable and faster connection than Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi connections can be unreliable, especially in a crowded area or if there is interference from other devices. A wired connection is less likely to be interrupted, which means that my Pi-hole DNS server will be able to block ads more consistently. In addition, a wired connection can provide a faster connection, which is important for a Pi-hole DNS server because it needs to be able to quickly respond to DNS requests. If my Pi-hole DNS server is not able to respond quickly, then I may experience delays when loading websites.In addition to being more reliable and faster, a wired connection also uses less power than Wi-Fi. This is important because my laptop is now running a Pi-hole DNS server, which requires more resources than a normal laptop. By using a wired connection, I can save power and extend the battery life of my laptop.I have configured my Debian OS so that my laptop never turns off automatically. If it runs on battery due to a power outage, I have it set to turn off when the battery level reaches 5%. Furthermore, my laptop now boots directly into shell, no GUI at all. This saves even more resources.However, in case I need to use my laptop for work, I can quickly switch back to Debian's graphical interface. The Pi-hole DNS server can keep working while I'm using the laptop as with 12 GB RAM, it's more than enough to prevent it from running out of memory.",5.0 out of 5 stars,✨FancyRat✨,38 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,4

Great value for the cost! The size is good, not too heavy, bright screen and great picture. Good battery life. Fast internet browsing with multiple tabs and has never crashed. Track pad works great! Fast program downloads. I wish the keyboard lit up, but it's only an issue in certain lighting. One issue I have is that the sound is terrible. It hurt my ears because it's so metallic. I don't even use it without headphones. May just be an issue with my individual laptop, but due to school, I can't send it back in to get fixed or replaced. Secondly, the laptop charger is an issue. It takes a universal charger and the wiring gets loose very easily and stops charging. I have dogs who bump into me and I'm already on my 3rd charger in 5-6 months.  I'd blame the dogs, but I've had other chargers last years despite the pups.

B0C43M8CFX,Ruzava-Celeron-Cooling-Support-Study-Purple,A Great PC Laptop for the Money. Very Fast.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023","I bought the AOCWEI laptop at the beginning of last week and it arrived promptly the next day. I was very pleased at the price being so reasonable but was very interested in seeing if it would live up to the specifications that were listed for it.So far, it has been performing very well. As I already mentioned it is very fast. I know that solid state hard drives are much faster than their mechanical predecessors but this exceeded my expectations. It boots up into Windows 11 in about 14-16 seconds from being totally turned off. Various items load and folders open very quickly. It is a joy to operate from that perspective alone.The screen resolution is very good and more than adequate for my needs. For the average person that needs a solid PC that performs very well and is well built, this is an amazing fit for a modest budget. It is nice and thin, and feels very solid to hold. It is more than adequate with standard USB and USB-C ports as well as an SD card slot to expand your storage. There is also a headphone jack that is compatible with commonly available ear buds and all of these various ports are well-identified on the bottom of the laptop.This is my first experience with Windows 11 and I was pleased that it came already installed on this laptop. It was easy to set up and I am finding it to be interesting but not difficult to use after having been used to Windows 10 for so long.The warranty on this machine is probably the best I have seen for a PC laptop. I hope that I never have to use it but it is nice to know that it has a lifetime warranty available. I had to look twice when I saw that, just to be sure my eyes were not deceiving me.All in all, if you have only a modest budget, I think that you would be hard-pressed to find any other laptop that is this solid, with the memory and storage that this one has, and that performs as well as this one does for the same or less money.",5.0 out of 5 stars,J.

Its processor can reach speeds up to 2.9GHz ensuring that I can finish my tasks quickly and efficiently.Additionally, this laptop has a 1920 x 1200 2K screen and although it isn’t 4K, it still delivers clear and well-defined images, which is good enough for me since I am mainly using this laptop for basic tasks and to watch videos.In addition, this laptop can support dual Wi-Fi, so I can be connected to two different networks simultaneously which I appreciate.Furthermore, this laptop came with 12GB RAM and 512GB SSD of storage, and it can be expanded up to 1TB SSD or 2.5” HDD.However, since I am not a gamer and neither am I using this laptop for heavy-duty work, I currently don’t need a laptop with an extremely powerful processor and way more RAM.Because I am using this laptop mainly to browse the internet, check on my social media accounts, and watching videos so this laptop fits my needs.I like that this laptop has a cooling fan, which keeps my device running smoothly even after I have been using it for many hours.Although the laptop has built-in 12GB RAM and 512GB SSD storage space, it can support up to 1TB SSD expansion, making this laptop more than capable of handling multi-application and multimedia workflows efficiently and quickly.And if in the future I need even more storage, I can expand its storage capacity to reach a 2.5” HDD or 1TB SSD. Nevertheless, the storage capacity that this laptop has now is more than enough to store my files, documents, media, and even some large applications.Therefore, I am quite pleased with my laptop because it came with a Celeron Intel N5095 processor, it works at a speed of 2.0 GHz, but it can reach speeds up to 2.9GHz, this laptop has a 4-core configuration, it is currently running on the latest Windows 11 operating system, it has a cooling fan to prevent overheating, and I can always add more SSD or HDD storage to increase its storage capacity in the future if I need to.",5.0 out of 5 stars,💖Dannie💖,10 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,4

Its fast, smooth, quiet, doesn't lag, doesn't crash and the big screen is perfect for multitasking, watching movies & streams and playing games on. Customer services is also really nice, helpful, and understanding. As long as you have your order number they will help you with whatever problem you may have with this laptop.I bought this laptop in October 2023 mainly for online school and it's been holding up great. I have tackled alot of late night projects and assignments on it. My only complaint is that the keyboard doesn't light up which makes it a little difficult to see the buttons in a dark room, but that's a me problem, something i can fix myself if i want to.

This is particularly useful when running demanding applications or playing graphics-intensive games, as it helps prevent overheating and ensures optimal performance.Plus it's a beautiful red, from the casing to the keys. And that red casing holds a very nice bright and colorful screen. I couldn't be happier with this.Coolest feature - can lay open perfectly flat.

I searched and reviewed laptops for about a month looking for a laptop for my wife. I found myself continually coming back to this one………….The specs and price just made it too good to pass up and it has exceeded my expectations in every aspect……..Windows 11 Intel N5095 Processor 1920X1200 2K resolution 12 Gig Ram 512GB SSD and 1TB 2.5 HD expansion are you kidding me Laptops twice this price don’t pack all of this into them!!!!My wife was using a 10+ year old HP which was painfully slow and outdated. It took forever just to boot up.The laptop comes packed really well including its own airbag enclosure in the box was completely amazed at the care in which it was shipped.Being a bling girl purple was the perfect choice when she first saw it was love at first site the size color and its so light and easy to handle.Performance is blazing fast and screen is bright and stunning crisp clear graphics. The 12 gig of ram allows you to multi task with ease and and the wireless speed is awesome.I even added a 1TB SSD to the available HD slot and was able to bring all her documents and files over so the laptop serves as a replacement desktop as well.Battery life is stellar shes getting 4+ hours before needing to plug it in couldn’t be happier with that.The support for this laptop has been outstanding even sent a detailed email with pictures for setting it up. I have purchased expensive gaming computers etc over the years and have never experienced so much support without even asking….Warranty registration was as simple as an email to them with my Amazon Order number and it was done.So for her Christmas in September LOL she couldn’t be happier!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Richard Kopp,14 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,2,4

B0874VTDHG,Acer-Chromebook-Celeron-Display-CB315-3H-C4QE,Works fine for virtual school,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2020","We got this for our daughter to use when the 2020/2021 school year started and our school district was doing virtual school. It has held up, and we will continue to use it since she isn't going back to in-person learning any time soon. It handles Zoom calls just fine, but the Chrome OS doesn't allow all of the Zoom features (customized backgrounds). That's fine since it keeps my daughter focusing on the school work and not playing with the app. Batter life hasn't been an issue when she unplugs it to do Physical Education videos in the living room.  Her headphones with inline microphone work just fine. As a Windows user, I had to figure out the Chrome OS interface and where things are located, but its fairly intuitive and online help is readily available.

If their screen was as bad as this one it would not have been a 3.  I had a 14"" Acer that was great and years older than this one; it's updates expired.

This new unit, booted up right away after putting in my SSID and Password. A word of advise make sure you use caps when needed. This review is being completed on my new HP Chromebook now seemingly fully functional. Please forgive my spelling errors as this is the first time using this device and the shortcuts, I have yet to learn. The reason this Chomebook is my chorse for now, is that google says all work is in the cloud and therefore reduces viruses, on that we shall see. Another reason is that the battery life is reported as being 13 hours of continuous use, again we shaal see. As of now I have no complaints. However expect an update soon.UPDATE.....Tuesday April 26, 2022I have been using this Chromebook for a year and feel that this is an investment that was well worth every penny that I spendAll that was promised has been achieved. I have experienced what this unit can do. I am glad of my choice. The battery life on my Chromebook is great.

B08529LPLZ,HP-Chromebook-14-inch-Touchscreen-14a-na0030nr,Nice laptop - Crashes Modems/Routers with no fix,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2021","Pros: Nice build and feel, great speakers, simple setup, great valueCons: Within a few minutes of connecting to my wifi, it killed the internet connections to all other devices including its own connection. We have a rather common modem/router, the Arris panoramic models you get on rental from Comcast or Cox, in the west.After working with Amazon and then HP support, it became evident the issue is a modem driver within the computer needing to be updated. HP support claimed it was a known issue with my router/modem -- yet they didn't troubleshoot it and didn't ask which manufacturer/model device I had. In theory, the problem (a driver) is fixable..... if you can get the driver downloaded and added to the computer. In this case, this chromebook does not have an ethernet port -- so there's no actual way to install the driver and address the problem without loading it on a USB drive, downloaded from another computer, or sending in the computer for repair.Summary: You may have a modem or router that doesn't conflict or have a driver issue and be perfectly fine. I wasn't able to experience much beyond the handful of minutes it would be connected. However, there's no way to know in advance if you will encounter this problem or not. If you're willing to risk it and have the time to a) work with support or find/load the driver yourself, and/or b) return the device (stick to the 30 day window), then proceed with caution. Otherwise, I recommend passing on this and going with something else.For reference, in our situation we ended up going with a Lenovo C340 Chromebook for just a little bit more money with a better processor, more RAM, bigger screen (a flipable touchscreen). My router/model and internet connection have been fine with the Lenovo.",1.0 out of 5 stars,KP,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,5

I had serious problems with the first one - the computer would crash a couple of times each day when it went to sleep. I returned it and purchased another. Same problem!I later found out the reason. The monitor I have it connected to is set to DisplayPort version 1.4 which these 2018 Macbooks don't support. I found an article about this but links aren't allowed here. I'm using a Samsung 49 inch ultrawide. In the monitor's menu I was able to change the DP setting to 1.2 and since having done that everything works fine.Aside from the rebooting issue, the power adapter that came with the first one was crap and didn't work after the initial charge so I went ahead and ordered a different one which cost around $30.All in all I would say the cost to value benefit of this product is pretty good. A new model with 16gb of ram, and 512gb hard drive (albeit with an M2) is around double this price. This laptop runs everything I need it to well including the latest MacOS.Physically, both laptops looked great very little noticeable wear & tear.

GMAIL is messy and Google Drive is inferior to OneDrive and I don't like that Google made me have a Gmail account, etc.Until I learn more, I still prefer Microsoft OS and products.  But I do like the Chromebook for it quick boot up, size etc.  The ACER 311 with touch screen, etc is nice.  The ability to fold it backwards into a tablet is a worthy feature although I don't use it that way often.  But I don't like the fact that as a tablet it rests on the keyboard.The battery life is good - at least all day or more - and it recharges quickly.  When I take it to work I have a power cable in my bag, but have never had to use it.I wish it had a second USB-A port and an SD card port, but I bought a multi-port expansion hub that, although a bit inconvenient, meets my needs.A good device for the price.

One convenient feature of ChromebookOS is that when both are logged in to the same Google account, they both nearly replicate each other and ""look"" and function nearly the same.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Gerry,4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,5

B0C43KM56C,Spin-311-3H-Touchscreen-Convertible,Better than my previous Asus Chromebook,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2023","Though it looks exactly like my previous Asus Chromebook (model C101P) which reached its AUE, there's one major difference with this Acer model. And that's the battery's life which is pretty amazing. After being fully charged, this item keeps working for days which I consider a real plus. Other than that, I haven't encountered any problems with it yet. The touchscreen feature also works well. Highly recommended.UPDATE: I've had the Chromebook for almost three weeks now and today the screen suddenly froze leaving all keys and the pointer inoperable. Turning the power on and off had no effect. I'm sure others know the fix for this dilemma but I learned that simply pushing the ESC key (top row, fourth in from the left) and the power key simultaneously instantly solves the problem. Hopefully, it won't happen again but at least I know how to deal with it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Chance Wayne,12 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,5

Worthy successor to Spectre,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2023","Bought this machine to succeed my beloved Spectre with a 6th gen i7.  As a renewed item, it is nearly perfect, with only the tiniest nick where you don't see it.  The machine specs exceed it's predecessor by a healthy margin, the screen is bigger in a very similar body size, and the performance is great!Being a business machine, it lacks a micro-SD slot, but it does come with a fingerprint sensor which works nicely to log in with. The keyboard is fabulous, the touchscreen is beautiful, and the touchpad perfect.  And the sound is WOW for volume and clarity.  And they put the power key on the left edge where it belongs, and NOT on the keyboard where the delete key belongs.The charger is just weird - a black box with a 4 foot long fat wire attached to the middle of one edge and another slightly less fat 4 foot wire coming out at the middle of the opposite side.  Not sleek or easy to pack up.  Wouldn't have been a design I'd be really proud to create,  but it works and charges quickly.  Charging is USB PD -I think 65 watts.This machine was a great value, coming in at 1/3 the cost of my last machine.

B08H1BS4D7,HP-EliteBook-x360-G6-Touchscreen,Two nonfunctional ones  in a row,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2023","I was excited about this computer because of the low price and the good specs. It didn't bother me that it was refurbished because I have had descent success with refurbished in the past.The FIRST ONE I had a NON-FUNCTIONING CAMERA. When we were setting up the computer for face recognition, all it showed was snow where the picture was supposed to be. We confirmed it by going into the camera program and it also showed snow and no picture. The computer also had a large dent on the front corner where it had obviously been dropped hard. Not exactly what I would call ""excellent condition"". We contacted Amazon (5 stars for Amazon for their customer service) for a replacement and they gave us a pre-paid return shipping label and shipped a new one. Really painless.The SECOND ONE that we received had a column of KEYS THAT DIDN'T WORK (8ik,). This is a common way that laptop keyboards fail. At that point, it seemed obvious to me that the company selling these computers has some QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES. These are not hard to find issues if they had actually checked the computers. I don't mind testing computers (I've done all things computers for many years), but I shouldn't be somebody else's free tester.I decided to get a refund and go elsewhere. But the seller sent me a POSTAGE REQUIRED shipping label. I had two bad computers sold to me. I should not have to pay the shipping for the company's mistake! I tried multiple times for two days to call the company to try to resolve this, but the PHONE WAS ALWAYS BUSY. That doesn't give me a lot of confidence in this company. They are either overwhelmed with customer complaints or don't have good customer service. In the end, I ended up paying to send it back.I'M NOT BUYING AGAIN from this company. In my opinion, you are better off doing what I did and paying $100 more to buy it from Best Buy where the quality control is better.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Sam,5 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,5

Honestly, if this is a truly renewed product, it wasn't used for very long before being traded in. I would dare say that this machine is new. The battery life is exceptional. The screen is a force to be reckoned with.. I haven't had to turn it up past the lowest setting unless using it during the day at work. This machine handles tasks well.. even multitasking. Very fast and efficient laptop. If anything changes I will update this review.Update, 01/21/2023:  I must say that after a few days of this little guy being a daily driver I am nothing short of amazed. Perhaps I could feel this way because I've used a chromebook for the past two years and a Dell Latitude 7404 before that with an old intel core i5 w/8gb of ram running windows 10 pro? All I really do is Media/music/simple web browsing, occasional shopping and cloud based EMS software/apps for work and am the polar opposite of a ""power user"" who plays games and does host of other high demand things.. but nevertheless, for those activities that I engage in with my trust sidekick here, it has been a world of difference from what I am used to. I'm still learning the layout of Windows 11 (it upgraded for free the day after I purchased this laptop) but have not had a bad experience or any trouble yet. Very much worth it at this point.

It had a couple tiny dings on the edges but nothing noticeable.  It worked great for a few weeks, and then the keyboard started having issues.  The keys would stick and make multiple of each letter being typed.  That issue makes writing reports a lengthy process.  We used compressed air and went through the usual trouble shooting suggestions recommendations from Apple.  The problem was not resolved.  Then the battery started dying unusually fast.  We messaged the seller, only to be told we missed our return/repair date by 1 day.  They didn't offer any suggestions or support.  We pointed out that it was one day after the return/repair deadline and that we had already taken it to the Apple store for maintenance at our own expense, and had hoped the issues would be resolved.  Unfortunately, we have to take it in to the Apple store and have the battery and the top case replaced.

The speakers. When the laptop first arrived I had read all this stuff about the great speakers and they did sound great. Until I had the laptop for a couple months. Now I can hardly stand the rattly sound that comes out when I play videos. Thankfully I use headphones most of the time, but sometimes you want to watch a quick video without hooking up headphones. I didn't blare any music or drop my laptop or anything either so it's incredibly frustrating that it seemingly just broke out of nowhere.The actual functionality of this laptop is great. Compared to my old one that ran like a snail this works incredibly fast. The number pad being on the mouse pad is really neat. I use it occasionally. It took me a while to stop accidentally pulling up the calculator because that's right where my palm would hit on the mouse pad when I was just typing.I use this laptop everyday.

Motherboard faulty.4. No multi-monitor capability.5. Technicians from Lenovo were terrible - I mean awful! One decided the way for the unit to see an external hard drive I had used to backup the unit was to reformat it every single time I plugged it in.Any thoughts on why this might be a bad idea??Yes, before I could stop him, he wiped out all the memory on the external storage drive.Lenovo, of course took no responsibility for their technician.6.

B0979PC8DJ,Dell-Latitude-5414-Rugged-14,"Minor issues, but clean and working","Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2023","These rugged Latitude 5414s are in good working order.  I bought two of them for field employees.  ONE out of two had some minor scratches and blemishes, but barely noticeable.  They came preloaded with Windows 10, but the software used to load and parititon were not recognizable to me.  Also, it was the 1903 version so outdated and unsupported.  So I opted to reload everything with a base copy of Win10 22H2.  Everything loaded fine.  Had to change the BIOS to load from external USB in EUFI mode.  No big deal there.  Screens were clean and scratch free.  All keyboard keys and touch pads were very clean and in working order.  Touch screen works great.The only other thing is that I am guessing one of these motherboards must have been replaced during the ""renewing"" process.  Upon reload, one of the laptops automatically activated its Windows digital license, whereas the other did not have one.

B0979PC8DJ,Dell-Latitude-5414-Rugged-14,dropping my rating,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","Update - Been a few weeks since I first used the laptop but today I wanted to install some additional software.  It's a BUST, B and N keys no longer work.  So, this laptop worked for approximately four hours and now, unless I can figure how to get the B and N keys to work, it's a door stop.Up front I wanted to say it's my fault.  I was looking for a small rugged Windows computer to use with a few mechanic programs - mainly ForScan.  Since I would take it while traveling it had to be tough, resistant to dust, not too heavy, and a screen I could see in sunlight.  This Dell has almost all of my needs - it is definitely tough.  It has dust ports covering everything.  It appears the battery and perhaps HHD are also accessible from each side.  I'm guessing it's the battery and HHD but with no manual, I could be wrong.  I used the Dell for the first time yesterday and after an long setup time; not blaming the Dell but trying to get through Windows caused me to reboot the laptop three times when Microsoft froze.  After setup and some personal software installed, I used the Dell on battery for about 90-mins without issue.  Sitting in my truck with the sun beating in, I was able to read the screen and that was a good thing.  My only issue and it's my fault, is the Dell is larger than I was expecting.  Of course it is heavy - given it's design and construction that wasn't a surprise and since it's in my truck 90% of the time or on my work bench, I don't think the weight will be a problem.  So, after just 48-hrs of use, we are happy.  Getting ready for a four month overlanding adventure and the Dell is going along, so we'll see if I need to update my review.",1.0 out of 5 stars,bluesy,,Verified Purchase,1,5

B0979PC8DJ,Dell-Latitude-5414-Rugged-14,I'd like to say...,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2022","I want to say I love this, but I don't know if I do. Only the laptop in the box, no charge on the laptop and no charging cord to turn it on. Maybe I'm crazy to assume that should come in the box with the laptop. I'll search for a charging cord and maybe, just maybe amazon forgot to include it and they'll overnight it to me. On the positive side it's well built, my HP was held together with gorilla glue and my 4 month old Dell cracked on the screen and it's held together with clamps so I opted for a rugged Dell and already I'm disappointed. Maybe we should bring manufacturing back to America to get quality item. That foreign stuff ain't impressing me much.  ""UPDATE""- I contacted the company and they sent my cord right out, I bought this because my new laptop case fell apart at 3 months old, this rugged case should last and last. It doesn't have 10 key, but I can live with that. Laptop is functioning well and it's very sturdy so I am very happy now.

B086KJBKDW,Acer-i5-9300H-GeForce-Keyboard-AN515-54-5812,A humble way to play,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2020","I tend to prattle exhaustively so I tried to divvy up my numerous opinions into sections you might find relevant.Now/Future = I've been very pleased with this laptop, and I do consider it a great deal for the six hundy spent (on the 9th Gen Intel Core i5-9300H). Not only does it perform splendidly as it comes ""right out the box"", but it's also upgradeable in the near future as tech advances and my finances allow. I've been using it for hours on end everyday for almost one month.Multitasking = I can run WoW (weeeeee!!) while simultaneously streaming music on Spotify in my web browser. Beyond that, I can also minimize my game and music to do a quick Google on whatever boss I'm trying to squelch as I solo dungeons with my Night Elf Demon Hunter. No lag or stuttering while multitasking whatsoever. Nice. B-)Graphics quality = It comes with 2 graphics cards, so be sure to check your in-game settings to make sure the best card is selected. Streaming Netflix and running WoW are lovely in a way I wasn't able to appreciate on my previous HP laptop. My only concern is that once in a while I've seen a rolling screen dim from top to bottom for a split second before it returns to normal. It has only happened a couple of times in the past month I've owned this, so?Pre-installed software = I had to find workarounds to disable Bing and Microsoft Edge, but in the end I can now use the search box on the start bar and it opens Google results in Chrome. Those being my preferred search engine and web browser. It wasn't terribly difficult as an amateur tinkerer.Heat = Sometimes I use the laptop on my actual lap (go figure), and when I've been immersed in my addiction for 4-5 hours, it gets rather warm. Almost hot. The pre-installed Nitrosense app allows you to manage the fan settings in order to allay this. Also of note is that the heat escape is on the right side, which means south paws keep their leading hand cool and us orthodox boxers get a warm periodic reminder to move our hand away from the keyboard. In plain words: the heat from the fans blows directly where one would naturally rest one's hand on a mouse (if you use one, however, a mouse is not included).Keyboard = The keys are comfortably spaced, appropriately sensitive to touch, and all are in working condition. The value of the number pad on a laptop cannot be understated!! The red backlight on the keyboard by default times out after 30 seconds. Finding the right key to strike first on an all-black keyboard after the backlight turns off was obnoxious to me. After some searching, I found that this too is changeable in the Nitrosense app. Weird place to put it, but ok. Hit the ""(N)"" key in the top left of the number pad, then click the Settings gear inside Nitrosense, and click to toggle off the ""backlight off after 30 seconds"" option. This might not be available on every model, but take a gander.Battery life = The battery lasts for a decent amount of time when simply browsing and streaming music: several hours, give or take. But I prefer/recommend plugging in the power cord when I know I'm about to sit down for a long session of questing. (""Just one more quest!!"")Port/Cable management = Speaking of the power cable... It must have been a desperate decision to seat it on the righthand side of the laptop in the middle. The configuration of the internal hardware almost certainly has to be to blame for this. It seems like they tried to offset this inconvenience by making the power cable with a immediate 90 degree bend so you can swivel it (hopelessly) out of the way.Final summation = I listed things things that I believe could be improved which were mostly cosmetic in nature and were either adjustable or could be lived with. But on the whole, this laptop has been a game-changer for my usual activities and has truly been a ""best bang for your buck"" experience. I recommend it for anyone who is maybe moderately into gaming but mostly wants a very reliable and delightful experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Zoe,40 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,5
B086KJBKDW,Acer-i5-9300H-GeForce-Keyboard-AN515-54-5812,Excellent device!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2020","I bought this laptop both for school and casual gaming and I’m very pleased! I’ve always built my own desktops to spend less for better parts but needed a laptop for school. After looking at some in the $500-$700 range I found this one and after a look over and reading some reviews I decided to buy it. I managed to purchase the Nitro 5 9th gen for $600 + tax. (Sale) decided to get another 8gb of DDR4 and a 500gb M.2 for all my games. The storage that comes with the laptop is more than enough for school work especially with most files being in the cloud. I got a crucial 8GB DDR4 2666 SODIMM for ram and a WD Blue 3D Nano 500GB SSD (which I have installed but have yet to set up)With both of these upgrades the laptop runs great! Now that you know a little about what’s been done to the laptop and it’s intended use (in my case) let’s jump into some pros and cons after 3 weeks of use.Pros:•Good specs for the price•Easily upgraded•PLENTY of ports•Runs great•Full keyboard (takes some getting used to)•Not too heavy•Easy to use temperature/fan software•Good battery life when on power save•Good quality on the webcamCons:•The bottom of the screen is a little flimsy•While gaming the CPU runs 74°C-80°C which is a little hotter than I’d like but to be expected in a laptop•Does need to be plugged in for peak performance but the same goes for all/most laptops•Charge port is on the right side of laptop towards the middle which can be minor inconvenience when using a mouse•Not a huge fan of the red but beggars can’t be choosers and at least it was done well.•Took about a week to come in IIRC but no biggieAs you can see the cons are mostly just nitpicking little things I don’t particularly care for. That’s because overall I’m very happy with this device! There are just some minor things but not at deal breakers. I usually don’t bother with writing reviews this long but I know there are people in the position I was in a month ago. Love the laptop so far and don’t think you will regret your purchase! Unless you get a bad unit, which I can’t speak on because I got a good one. I’m sure ACER is more than willing to replace faulty units. Hope I was able to help with your decision! Best of luck in your laptop search! Will update with any issues or new findings.",5.0 out of 5 stars,SpencerKG,8 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,5

B086KJBKDW,Acer-i5-9300H-GeForce-Keyboard-AN515-54-5812,"Good for the money, with some pronounced limitations","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2020","Further Update 4-5-2021: At the current price of $748, I think you can do better than this. I spent about that much including an additional 16MB RAM, for a total of 24MB, and an additional 1TB SSD. But I'm happy I got it and if the price drops back down to around what I paid before the upgrades, $599, it still seems like a good deal.UPDATE 3-24-2021: I had to send my desktop unit in for repair about a month ago. That took about two weeks because it got stuck in transit when Texas got closed down by bad weather, and I had to use the laptop as my primary computer during that time. I connected it to my graphics monitor via the HDMI port, plugged a powered USB hub running four external hard drives, my graphics tablet and my webcam into one USB port, and used the other two USB ports for a card reader and wireless mouse. So, pretty much maxed out all the connectivity options including the ethernet port. Obviously I was not running all this off the battery.Other than time-wasting, I mostly use the computer for photo editing. The images are from a full-frame camera so the files are quite large to start and I often enlarge them. Editing uses a lot of memory and CPU/GPU juice. I had added 16GB of memory when I got the machine, which came in handy.  As one would expect, the laptop didn't perform as well as the souped-up desktop does: everything took longer and it got frustrating at times. I wished I had added a larger SSD, which I've now done (another $100, bringing the total including the additional memory up to about $750). Ultimately, though, I got everything done that needed doing and I'm still impressed with the machine. It may be outdated already, I haven't looked, but I'm happy with the purchase and it definitely kept me sane while the desktop was gone, which my old laptop would not have done.This is a preliminary review of the Nitro 5 with the 9th Gen Intel Core i5-9300H and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650. I've had the machine for two weeks now. I paid $600 and dropped an additional $50 on a 16gb RAM stick, for a total of 24gb. I bought it because it was the least expensive unit I could find with a discrete GPU. I wanted something I can use for basic photo editing when I travel or when I feel like sitting in a cafe for a while, because I'm an optimist who believes both those things will be routine again some day. I'm not a gamer and can't speak to its capabilities for that.First the things I don't like:1) the keyboard. The keys are serviceable but a bit mushy. I prefer a more clicky keyboard but that's really a matter of taste and not function, and after two weeks I've adjusted to it. It's a good size, not cramped, and has a full-sized numerical pad. What I really don't like is that it's basically unusable in the daytime without the backlight turned up most of the way, and the backlight goes off when you pause typing for a few seconds, presumably to save battery. I don't understand that design decision. If you really want to save battery, make a keyboard that you can see without the backlight on. And the shift functions on the keys don't stand out that well even with the backlight. Maybe it's a gaming aesthetic thing, but I don't like it.2) The touchpad. It's just not very accurate. Moving between open tabs on a browser or trying to select tools in Photoshop or Lightroom and related plugins is a pain. I just use a mouse. I don't know what gamers use touchpads for but I can't imagine they'd like this one very well.3) Battery life. With the GPU idle, just using the unit for browsing, email and some writing, I got a bit more than five hours on a charge. When I started doing some moderately intensive photo editing involving the GPU, battery life dropped dramatically. If you're doing anything CPU/GPU intensive for any length of time you'll most likely want to keep it plugged in.4) Webcam. If I'm home I'm using my desktop webcam, and if I'm out I'm using my phone. The one on the unit is sort of a disaster. I guess that's where they're saving money. I would think anybody using the computer for Zoom or to stream would want to use an external USB one.5) Weight. This is a chonky fellow. I took it in my camera backpack on a shoot involving a lot of walking and noticed the extra couple pounds over the laptop it replaced. Not a big issue, though.6) Audio. The speakers are muddy and weak. You'll want to use headphones for music or gaming. It comes with Waves Maxx Audio, which I use on my desktop, but no amount of equalizing or enhancing is going to save these speakers. I expect nothing from laptop audio in this price range, and I got it.The keyboard backlight is the most aggravating of all those concerns for me. Classic example of form over function. Battery life is second, the touchpad third, and the webcam fourth. None of the issues come close to being deal breakers.Things I like:1) Performance. This is a $600 laptop with a decent four-core processor and a discrete GPU. Would I like an i7 or better and the RTX 2060? Sure. Do I want to pay another $500 or more for them? Why no: no I do not. It moved along pretty well right out of the box, and  and with the inexpensive RAM upgrade it positively zips. Again, I can't speak to the gaming capabilities, but I'm really pleased with the performance for my needs. I'll have to add some storage at some point, as I expect many people will, but that's pretty inexpensive these days too.2) Construction: as the weight would indicate, this thing is solid. Despite the plastic body, nothing about it feels cheap. There's not much flex to the screen. The only thing I don't like about it is that the back is a solid piece that has to be completely removed to upgrade the RAM or the drives. It'd be nice if it had access panels for those. Prying it apart was anxiety-inducing. You should note there's an included SSD cable but it's not installed and it's tiny so put it somewhere safe and install it the first time you have the back off.3) The screen. I was quite pleasantly surprised by the brightness and accuracy. I did some work on a few pics that I then looked at on my graphics monitor, which cost more than this machine, and the colors were pretty much right on. I can't speak to it for gaming purposes, the frame/refresh rate is more or less irrelevant to me, but it's better than I expected for what I'm doing with it.4) Heat management. This is exceptional. The chassis is built to dissipate heat, and the two fans work really well, independently of one another, and quietly. Acer provides a heat management utility that allows the user to manually control the fans and to keep track of the processor temperatures. I've used the laptop as an actual laptop for up to two hours without appreciable discomfort.5) Bloatware. There's hardly any, and the Acer utilities are actually useful. I had to get rid of the preinstalled Norton Security and Microsoft Office trials but that's an easy job.6) Appearance. It's fine. It has the sort of angular, aggressive styling that seems to be de rigueur for gaming, and in this instance the styling incorporates the heat dissipation features so it's functional as well. I'd prefer something other than black but it's fine.7) Ports. It has an HDMI out, 2 USB 3.0, a USB-C, a USB 2.0, an ethernet port, an earphone jack and of course a power input. Pretty good collection. You can get by without Thunderbolt ports.tl;dr: As you would expect from a machine at this price point, Acer made some compromises. The camera and speakers are subpar, and the unit is mostly plastic. They also made some design decisions that are borderline incomprehensible to me, as with the keys not showing up well in good light without the backlight. The heat handling is great, the screen performance is better than I expected, it's fast and powerful, and I'm still surprised at getting even an entry-level GPU at this price. For a non-gamer using it as a photo editing and general purpose laptop, the value seems exceptional.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Weldon Berger,70 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,5
B086KJBKDW,Acer-i5-9300H-GeForce-Keyboard-AN515-54-5812,Great for Moderate Gaming,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2020","I really enjoy this laptop, It's super quick. Loads into windows under 4 seconds.I added a ""Kingston Technology HyperX Impact 8GB 2666MHz DDR4 CL15 260-Pin SODIMM Laptop Memory (HX426S15IB2/8)"" ram module for making the Ram 16GB total, this will work best with the shared GPU memory.YOU WILL NEED MORE RAM FOR HEAVIER GAMESThe onboard GPU memory is shared with your ram when in gaming mode.I played space engineers, which requires around 5GB of VRAM for medium gameplay, it leaked into my actual ram, but with the hyperx upgrade there was only slight FPS drops but not enough to affect gameplay. Ram is important.I recommend windows 10 Pro 1909, don't use 2004 on this laptop will die really quick in Win 10 2004. Lasted about 3 hours under full load, whist 1909 lasted around 7 hours under full load, close to expected battery life.The Intel CPU Turbos to 3.98 Ghz while plugged in, if you set it that way.If you plan to install linux, the NVME will not be detected at boot time, to fix this, head to bios and on the first tab or second tab press ""CTRL"" + ""S"" to bring up a setting and change and disable intel optane firmware to use nvme in linux, as when you boot a non windows OS, the nvme will be placed into sleep mode.As for a extra nvme slot, i picked up ""Western Digital 250GB WD Blue SN550 NVMe Internal SSD - Gen3 x4 PCIe 8Gb/s, M.2 2280, 3D NAND, Up to 2,400 MB/s - WDS250G2B0C"" from many other users, as this will take full advantage of the laptops firmware and hardware. You can pick higher space storage, but as a light gamer, this was enough for me.As for the 2.5"" drive, i picked up a ""ST1000LM024 HN-m101Mbb"" It's a 1TB Mechanical Drive with decent write and read speeds for lighter games, and game storage. Granted it is slower, but for this laptop its perfect and I can get full R/W speeds that were advertised. If you notice, it's the same drive inside the XBox 1 - 1st Gen, so You can game on it as well, not as fast load times, but its fast enough to still enjoy a game.Besides the battery life, this is a really good laptop if you go out to a friends house for a night and do some moderate gaming like a LAN party, or a small road trip, or sitting out side for a few hours.I do not recommend taking this on a flight. Unless you get an extra battery.As of this message, I am using this as my main pc, and quite enjoy it, the Intel i5v9 is great and the GTX 1650 plays most games on Medium/High at 50/60fps.Also another note to stay on 1909, is that windows f--ked up the NVIDIA auto select method for Intel Graphics and GPU graphics, so some games will default to intel CPU instead of NVIDIA.Also, This laptop can play COD: Cold War at High settings with 48/55fps under heavy scenes and a perfect 60fps on normal fighting.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Joe Koen,8 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,5
B086KJBKDW,Acer-i5-9300H-GeForce-Keyboard-AN515-54-5812,Hefty but Heroic! A real Gamer’s laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2021","This is the first gaming laptop I ever owned, although I have owned about 6 other laptops previously. This is a great gaming platform with just a few cons.First, the Pros: Nice sized display with high resolution and a clear, bright display. Sound is incredible in quality, although the volume is very low. Keyboard is crispy, and the backlight can be dimmed or brightened or turned off. Touchpad is responsive although I prefer to use a wireless mouse instead. WIFI has a good strong signal and connections are quick and reliable. Plenty of ports, and built-in cooler makes this a well rounded player. Upgrades are easy to do, and with 2 NVME slots plus a 2.5 drive slot, you won’t be hurting for storage space. The memory can be upgraded to 32GB if you need it.CONS: just a few, and none are deal breakers for me. The first is the weight. Not sure what it is, but this is no lightweight. It’s hefty!! Second, Acer went for some fancy design with the case that has the corners chopped diagonally. It’s not actually sharp, but it can be a bit pokey if you’re balancing it with one hand on your knee while battling behemoths in Dauntless. That’s pretty much all I could find to say negatively.All in all, this is a great laptop at a reasonable price for the specs. It will definitely stand up to whatever you can dish out in your favorite games.",5.0 out of 5 stars,NetizenMT,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,5
B086KJBKDW,Acer-i5-9300H-GeForce-Keyboard-AN515-54-5812,An absolute powerhouse!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2023","I purchased the i5- 9300H Version with a GTX 1650 and 8 GB RAM. Out of the box this Laptop isn't the best unfortunately, so expect to have to spend a little extra to get it to feel like a gaming machine.After upgrading up to 16 GB of RAM I immediately noticed a massive difference in power. Going from nearly unplayable to 60-80 FPS in most games on Medium to High settings. Even some AAA games that came out recently can be played on this including Hogwarts Legacy, Dead Space Remake, and I even managed to get Far Cry 6 and Cyberpunk to run on this (Far Cry got 50-60 FPS and Cyberpunk got 40-50 FPS.I will say a big concern were the temps. The temps ranged between 90- 104 Celsius at times. This can be fixed with software that under-volts your CPU but make sure to watch plenty of YouTube videos if you are unfamiliar with that type of thing. After doing this myself my temps don't go above 65 even in intense games. I also recommend Laptop cooling pads, in my review image you see my laptop sitting on one, They help push a lot of hot air out from under the laptop.All in all this is a very solid purchase and its a fast little machine that does its job. Just keep in mind you'll need to upgrade it if you want to use it at its fullest capabilities.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cyrus Eccles,4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,5

B086KJBKDW,Acer-i5-9300H-GeForce-Keyboard-AN515-54-5812,"Its decent, but just to hot to handle.","Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2020","First of all  the performance is great for any game you want to play, however, not all games can run at 60 fps on the highest graphics. For example, Doom Eternal can run perfectly and stay at 60 fps on medium graphics.  That's actually saying a lot considering doom is a very demanding game.  Anything higher than medium will go past the 4gb vram limit. Now the big problem is the throttling. Yes this laptop's CPU can hit 4.1 GHz, that doesn't mean it can control the heat emitting from such power. I mean seriously, even at start up it would hit the 80* C range, the highest and scariest temp it has gotten to was 90* C!!!  At that temp the computer is basically killing itself. The fans do some good work but without a cooling pad it just cant get the airflow it needs. Even with the cooling pad its still in the 80* C range. So, This is what i did to fix it from throttling and keep it running cool and efficient (cooler temps mean better performance) I downloaded a application known as Throttle Stop, it is well known and trusted, HOWEVER it is VERY dangerous if you don't know what you doing. All i did was simply turn the GHz  multiplier down to 33 (this means the CPU runs at 3.30 GHz)  and then adjusted the Mv (millivolts) to -168Mv this is the magic number for me, now the CPU runs no hotter than 70* C, when playing arma 3 anyway. I have tried other demanding games and it seems to still throttle unfortunately, the next best thing is to limit the max power going to the CPU, to 99% this is done in the power management settings on windows. This is much safer, however, it makes the CPU run at 2.40 MHz (the base MHz) this will run cool! But it bottlenecks so much and just takes away the capability this computer has. So Final conclusion... This thing is literally to hot to handle, If the airflow and thermal paste were better it would run fine at 4.1 MHz but its just not. If your a tech person you could always reapply some better thermal paste but no telling if that would work better or not. Honestly tho, for this price, its OK. Just keep in mind that if you do get it, do not run it at 4.1 MHz. AND DO NOT TRY AND OVERCLOCK ANYTHING YOU WILL KILL IT AS IT IS ALREADY DYING OUT OF THE BOX.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Rebekah Isley,6 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,5

B0C43M8CFX,Ruzava-Celeron-Cooling-Support-Study-Purple,"Fully compatible with Linux, serves as Pi-hole DNS server and backup PC","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023","Besides my new, bold red laptop, there were a few items inside the box. I found a small, black wired USB mouse, a white charging adapter, a clear, washable keyboard protector and a short user manual.The laptop is thin and weighs below 4 pounds. It has four rubberized feet in each corner at the bottom side that slightly elevate it, so air can circulate beneath. The keyboard is red as well with white characters, has a keypad and many functions have to be called with the Fn button. However, it does have its own Volume control buttons. What I miss is lights for the keys. Yet, it has three indicator lights right above the keyboard on the left for Power On, Caps Lock and Num Lock.The touchpad is large and has a different tone of red. It makes a click sound when I press on it. It supports multThe 16 inch display has a resolution of 1920×1200. Its aspect ratio is 16:10, which is slightly wider than 16:9 but it’s a difference I can notice, especially when I’m working with office apps. I can tilt the screen up to 180 degrees. I find the colors are displayed accurately and lively. I can set the brightness with my keyboard or through the operating system.There are seven ports in total. On the right side are three ports: one USB 3.0, one headphone jack, on SD card slot. What I find curious is that there’s a small rectangular opening. I thought that would be another port but I couldn’t find any reference in the user manual. Yet, in the listing itself I could find a picture that labels it as lock but I could not find any more information on how to use that lock and what it actually locks. Maybe somebody can tell. Anyway, on the left side, there are four ports: again one USB 3.0, DC power, HDMI, and a type C USB port.On the bottom, I have quick access to the 512 GB SSD and HDD bay. With quick access I mean I don’t have to open up the whole laptop. I just have to unscrew to screws to remove the cover of the SSD; the same goes for the HDD bay.That said, I added a 2.5 inch 320 GB Seagate Hard Drive to the laptop and installed Debian 12 Bookworm. The installation of the second operating system went through without errors and I could boot into my new Linux OS in seconds. I encountered no hardware compatibility issues.By the way, secure boot was off by default and I haven’t changed anything in the BIOS which has been released by AMI on March 29, 2023.I also booted into the pre-installed OS, which is Windows 11. The first boot took long because I had to go through the first time setup and in the beginning, browsing wasn’t fast because Windows downloaded tons of updates. Yet, after the update, web browsing got back to normal.When I opened the task manager, I checked the performance tab and indeed, the laptop has 12 GB installed. However, what baffled me was that task manager listed open RAM slots. So, I opened up the command prompt and issued the following command: wmic memphysical get MaxCapacity. That told me the maximum RAM capacity the laptop can handle. I don’t remember the exact number but it was over 12 GB. So, I decided to open up the laptop to just find out there were no empty memory slots and the pre-installed memory is soldered together. In short, no way to add more RAM. Still, the RAM is decent enough for daily work. It’s 12 GB DDR4 SDRAM at 2400 Mhz.When I opened up the laptop, I could also see that it has a 38 watts battery. Fully charged, the battery lasts me slightly over six hours with a few applications open and viewing a few videos.The processor is an Intel Celeron Processor N5095 that was released in the first quarter of 2021 according to Intel’s website. I can do basic tasks like web browsing, email, office like powerpoint with it. It has four cores and can boost up to 2.9 GHz, which is enough power for most everyday tasks.When it comes to sound, the audio is ok as there are two speakers for stereo. However, I prefer to use my headset as I like to listen to songs at high volume. The built-in microphone captures sound clearly but I often end up using my headset’s mic but in either case, I can’t tell much difference. Recordings from both sound almost identical.The webcam’s resolution is ok but my face appears paler than in real life and movements show up slightly delayed. It’s also not compatible with Windows Hello’s face unlock feature. However, I don’t care as I will primarily use the laptop with Debian and rarely, if ever, use Windows.The laptop also has Bluetooth 4.2. I could pair it to my soundbar that I mainly use for my smart TV. I didn’t encounter any delays.I was able to connect my laptop to my home network using both 5G and 2.4G Wi-Fi. Even though it does not have an Ethernet port built-in, it instantly detected my USB-C hub with Ethernet. This is important to me because I use the laptop as a private Pi-hole DNS server. A Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker that blocks ads on all devices on my home network.A wired connection is important for a Pi-hole DNS server because it provides a more reliable and faster connection than Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi connections can be unreliable, especially in a crowded area or if there is interference from other devices. A wired connection is less likely to be interrupted, which means that my Pi-hole DNS server will be able to block ads more consistently. In addition, a wired connection can provide a faster connection, which is important for a Pi-hole DNS server because it needs to be able to quickly respond to DNS requests. If my Pi-hole DNS server is not able to respond quickly, then I may experience delays when loading websites.In addition to being more reliable and faster, a wired connection also uses less power than Wi-Fi. This is important because my laptop is now running a Pi-hole DNS server, which requires more resources than a normal laptop. By using a wired connection, I can save power and extend the battery life of my laptop.I have configured my Debian OS so that my laptop never turns off automatically. If it runs on battery due to a power outage, I have it set to turn off when the battery level reaches 5%. Furthermore, my laptop now boots directly into shell, no GUI at all. This saves even more resources.However, in case I need to use my laptop for work, I can quickly switch back to Debian's graphical interface. The Pi-hole DNS server can keep working while I'm using the laptop as with 12 GB RAM, it's more than enough to prevent it from running out of memory.",5.0 out of 5 stars,✨FancyRat✨,38 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,5

Great value for the cost! The size is good, not too heavy, bright screen and great picture. Good battery life. Fast internet browsing with multiple tabs and has never crashed. Track pad works great! Fast program downloads. I wish the keyboard lit up, but it's only an issue in certain lighting. One issue I have is that the sound is terrible. It hurt my ears because it's so metallic. I don't even use it without headphones. May just be an issue with my individual laptop, but due to school, I can't send it back in to get fixed or replaced. Secondly, the laptop charger is an issue. It takes a universal charger and the wiring gets loose very easily and stops charging. I have dogs who bump into me and I'm already on my 3rd charger in 5-6 months.  I'd blame the dogs, but I've had other chargers last years despite the pups.

B0C43M8CFX,Ruzava-Celeron-Cooling-Support-Study-Purple,A Great PC Laptop for the Money. Very Fast.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023","I bought the AOCWEI laptop at the beginning of last week and it arrived promptly the next day. I was very pleased at the price being so reasonable but was very interested in seeing if it would live up to the specifications that were listed for it.So far, it has been performing very well. As I already mentioned it is very fast. I know that solid state hard drives are much faster than their mechanical predecessors but this exceeded my expectations. It boots up into Windows 11 in about 14-16 seconds from being totally turned off. Various items load and folders open very quickly. It is a joy to operate from that perspective alone.The screen resolution is very good and more than adequate for my needs. For the average person that needs a solid PC that performs very well and is well built, this is an amazing fit for a modest budget. It is nice and thin, and feels very solid to hold. It is more than adequate with standard USB and USB-C ports as well as an SD card slot to expand your storage. There is also a headphone jack that is compatible with commonly available ear buds and all of these various ports are well-identified on the bottom of the laptop.This is my first experience with Windows 11 and I was pleased that it came already installed on this laptop. It was easy to set up and I am finding it to be interesting but not difficult to use after having been used to Windows 10 for so long.The warranty on this machine is probably the best I have seen for a PC laptop. I hope that I never have to use it but it is nice to know that it has a lifetime warranty available. I had to look twice when I saw that, just to be sure my eyes were not deceiving me.All in all, if you have only a modest budget, I think that you would be hard-pressed to find any other laptop that is this solid, with the memory and storage that this one has, and that performs as well as this one does for the same or less money.",5.0 out of 5 stars,J.

B0C43M8CFX,Ruzava-Celeron-Cooling-Support-Study-Purple,Great laptop for my everyday tasks.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2023","I like this laptop because it came with the Celeron Intel N5095 processor with its 4-core configuration, it delivers seamless and smooth performance for my everyday tasks.Whether I am browsing the web, working on documents, or even watching some videos, this laptop handles it all effortlessly. Its processor can reach speeds up to 2.9GHz ensuring that I can finish my tasks quickly and efficiently.Additionally, this laptop has a 1920 x 1200 2K screen and although it isn’t 4K, it still delivers clear and well-defined images, which is good enough for me since I am mainly using this laptop for basic tasks and to watch videos.In addition, this laptop can support dual Wi-Fi, so I can be connected to two different networks simultaneously which I appreciate.Furthermore, this laptop came with 12GB RAM and 512GB SSD of storage, and it can be expanded up to 1TB SSD or 2.5” HDD.However, since I am not a gamer and neither am I using this laptop for heavy-duty work, I currently don’t need a laptop with an extremely powerful processor and way more RAM.Because I am using this laptop mainly to browse the internet, check on my social media accounts, and watching videos so this laptop fits my needs.I like that this laptop has a cooling fan, which keeps my device running smoothly even after I have been using it for many hours.Although the laptop has built-in 12GB RAM and 512GB SSD storage space, it can support up to 1TB SSD expansion, making this laptop more than capable of handling multi-application and multimedia workflows efficiently and quickly.And if in the future I need even more storage, I can expand its storage capacity to reach a 2.5” HDD or 1TB SSD. Nevertheless, the storage capacity that this laptop has now is more than enough to store my files, documents, media, and even some large applications.Therefore, I am quite pleased with my laptop because it came with a Celeron Intel N5095 processor, it works at a speed of 2.0 GHz, but it can reach speeds up to 2.9GHz, this laptop has a 4-core configuration, it is currently running on the latest Windows 11 operating system, it has a cooling fan to prevent overheating, and I can always add more SSD or HDD storage to increase its storage capacity in the future if I need to.",5.0 out of 5 stars,💖Dannie💖,10 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,5

B0874VTDHG,Acer-Chromebook-Celeron-Display-CB315-3H-C4QE,Works fine for virtual school,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2020","We got this for our daughter to use when the 2020/2021 school year started and our school district was doing virtual school. It has held up, and we will continue to use it since she isn't going back to in-person learning any time soon. It handles Zoom calls just fine, but the Chrome OS doesn't allow all of the Zoom features (customized backgrounds). That's fine since it keeps my daughter focusing on the school work and not playing with the app. Batter life hasn't been an issue when she unplugs it to do Physical Education videos in the living room.  Her headphones with inline microphone work just fine. As a Windows user, I had to figure out the Chrome OS interface and where things are located, but its fairly intuitive and online help is readily available.

I don't know if the ever reviewers got a different laptop but it's so slow it's unusable! I used to be an ASUS Laptop fan, because I had great previous products with them. This one is so slow it's unusable. You CANNOT have two programs open at the same time. You CANNOT have 5 tabs open at the same time. It's that bad, it will glitch out while I'm listening to music so much so that the music makes a horrible sound. It genuinely unusable. I made the mistake of following the other reviews that said ""it gets better when you remove Microsoft S"" and ""it gets faster when you get through all the updates."" I should not have relied on those reviews because I went past my return date because I just had to get through ""one more update"" then it would be fast. IT NEVER WORKED. IT HAS ALWAYS IMPOSSIBLY SLOW! DO NOT TRUST REVIEWS ABOUT UPDATES! RUNAWAY FROM THIS COMPUTER AND SAVE YOURSELF FROM AMAZON COSTUMER SERVICE HELL! I have reached out to Amazon 4 times about this issue and 4 times they tell me they were going to give me a refund and 4 times there is nothing.

Since it will be dedicated to just this operation, I wanted an inexpensive but powerful laptop with a large clear screen. The 15.6"" screen is sharp, clear and visible from a distance and different angles without much distortion that you often find when viewing laptop screens from an angle. This Asus running Windows 10 Home (I converted it from Windows 10 S mode) runs my design program perfectly without any lag in speed or function. It's lightweight, sleek, the keyboard is easy to type on and colors render quite nicely on the screen. While it may not be up to gaming (not a gamer here) it's a perfect laptop for a student who needs basic computing needs and like me, someone who needs to run a windows-exclusive design program.Full disclosure: By submitting this I may qualify for an additional 90 day warranty. Why wouldn't I? I was about to submit my positive review anyway when I got he email offering the additional warranty.

It could barely open two tabs without crashing or giving me an error message. I couldn’t open apps without five to ten minutes of waiting and there was multiple times where it completely froze and I couldn’t even shut it down.

Laptop free floated in a box 3 times too big. Thankfully I didn't notice any damage from shipping.When I got it out of the box it had a full battery that died in 30 minutes just doing the setup. I also noticed a super bad screen burn, nice. Then to my great surprise the charger that came with the laptop plugged right in and charged a grand total of 2%. Every time I turn on the laptop there's a giant warning: ""THIS CHARGER IS NOT CORRECT AND WILL NOT CHARGE THIS LAPTOP"".  When inspecting the charger the plastic top is busted off.After using this Laptop for a few days it never charged over 2%. Burn in on the screen is super distracting. And trying to do anything like watching a video or downloading a game it immediately dies. Tried customer support, Amazon did nothing, the seller surprise surprise did nothing.To recap this re-manufactured laptop came in less packaging than boardgames from Amazon do. There is screen burn in and it's not subtle. Came with the wrong charger also busted no less. And the battery is shot.At the very least a re-manufactured laptop should have the screen, battery, and charger replaced AT THE BARE MINIMUM!

B08HJT1BKQ,HP-Chromebook-11-inch-Laptop-11a-na0010nr,"Amazing value, amazing battery life- a couple frustrating issues.","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2022","This is my first Chromebook, and overall I’m quite pleased with the purchase.  I’m mainly going to be using it for basic internet browsing and writing, so when I was shopping for the right model I was favoring cost, weight and battery life over other features like screen size and processing power. I ultimately felt this was the best balance of weight and battery life for the price.  I definitely wasn’t wrong about the battery life. I’m amazed. This thing lasts and lasts.  It’s not the fastest computer but it suffices for my use case.Two things that bother me.This first is the lack of an illuminated keyboard.  I knew it lacked one going into it, so I can’t complain that much. I just didn’t realize how much I’ve come to rely on it on my other laptops. I’m often using the computer in dark environments, where it’s difficult to see the keys.  Again, I knew this wasn’t an included feature, so this isn’t really a complaint as much as something to give extra consideration to before purchasing. With that being said, even with the lack of the illuminated keyboard, I don’t regret the purchase, and would buy again.Which takes me to the second point. There is an issue with some of the video playback. In extra bright scenes in videos on YouTube and elsewhere, there is some discoloration in the highlights. Meaning, that in certain areas of the video, particularly that are white, there is some blue artifacts/pixelation happening. I have confirmed that this is an issue with this model and have seen it replicated in floor models at Best Buy and heard other people complain about this. I’m frustrated that HP has allowed this to continue to be a problem without offering a fix. As I said, most of my use cases involve writing; so video watching isn’t high up on my list of priorities. If it was, this would be a much bigger problem for me.Overall, I’m pleased with the purchase given the price, and recommend it for anybody who is looking for an inexpensive, long battery life Chromebook option.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jeremy,32 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,6

I've previously owned larger HP ones and I wanted to go with something different and a chrome operating system because I am tired of windows and their non stop updates.. First of all battery life is excellent, once you close the computer it sleeps and uses almost zero battery, then when you open it it's immediately ready to use, doesn't have to boot up or anything. Also the charging port is the same upside down or right side up! You don't have to fiddle with the port to rightly plug it in.  Important to note, set-up was a little tricky as you have to sign in as a user/ owner to take it out of ""guest mode"" which allows you to bookmark your favorite pages to immediately have access to your faves, that involves setting up a Google Gmail account or using an existing one u have, other than that it's a handy, simple unit that is very well worth the price.  I suggest googling the process if you are unsure.. I'm not very computer savvy but I figured it out in a matter of minutes 😁 I recommend this computer.. The mousepad is also a simple tool, which has left click and right click on the pad without extra buttons so you will have to get used to that I do suggest maybe getting an actual mouse and mousepad because the panel is a little tricky to navigate other than that a great 👍 item",5.0 out of 5 stars,cappy73,25 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,6

Mind you, it would get to 99% CPU usage with no apps open, only running the chrome browser with ONE tab open watching Netflix. I bought this just for basic usage of online browsing, watching Netflix or YouTube, checking emails, listen to music (the speakers are a bit low, wish it was a little louder) and just again very basic things. It did crash on me once while again just one tab opened watching Netflix. It would react to my clicking but it was very delayed and slow. Sometimes moving the cursor around is also a little delayed so it doesn't have the best reaction time when clicking on something. It's not touch screen and no backlit keyboard but it wasn't something I was personally interested in and I don't believe it mentions it in the ads either. Arrived next day and it's very lightweight, does feel a little like cheapish plastic so be careful moving the screen back and forth but the overall packaging was nice and new. You get what you pay for and I really wasn't expecting much from it. If you buy this with LOW expectations and for simple/basic use then it's a great little Chromebook. I've deleted all extra apps that came preinstalled that I personally didn't need and made sure everything is updated and clean. Sometimes your Chrome extensions can make Chrome use up a lot of CPU so be on the lookout for that (I decided to remove some extensions but yet the Chromebook does still take up a lot of space). Overall a great little Chromebook for travel but just don't expect anything crazy or anything like a laptop. This isn't a laptop, its a Chromebook. So no Windows OS just Chrome.

It can easily last you 10 to 14 hours.  However, the battery indicator is not accurate.  It will tell you that you have 10 hours of battery in one minute, and then 14 hours the next minute, and in less than 30 seconds, it tells you I have only 8 hours left.2) The Bluetooth connection is completely unreliable.  I have two devices attached using Bluetooth, a headphone, and a mouse.  They take turns disappearing from the connection.  And many times, the Bluetooth will shut off altogether by itself.  Annoyingly, it happens every 4 to 5 hours meaning that if I am working on this computer, I have to reboot the computer at least 2 to 3 times a day to keep using Bluetooth.3) Internet WiFi is very weak using this computer.  If you are streaming movies and browsing the Internet at the same time using different windows, the computer will slow down to ... let's say, no response at all.4) Very light, easy to carry around.5) The screen quality is very poor, so poor that I got headaches after using it for a day.

B0979PC8DJ,Dell-Latitude-5414-Rugged-14,"Minor issues, but clean and working","Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2023","These rugged Latitude 5414s are in good working order.  I bought two of them for field employees.  ONE out of two had some minor scratches and blemishes, but barely noticeable.  They came preloaded with Windows 10, but the software used to load and parititon were not recognizable to me.  Also, it was the 1903 version so outdated and unsupported.  So I opted to reload everything with a base copy of Win10 22H2.  Everything loaded fine.  Had to change the BIOS to load from external USB in EUFI mode.  No big deal there.  Screens were clean and scratch free.  All keyboard keys and touch pads were very clean and in working order.  Touch screen works great.The only other thing is that I am guessing one of these motherboards must have been replaced during the ""renewing"" process.  Upon reload, one of the laptops automatically activated its Windows digital license, whereas the other did not have one.  So I had to purchase an OEM Win10 key to activate the second one (not a big expense).  Othe than the issues mentioned above, everything works great.All is as described in the description.  I would buy from them again.",5.0 out of 5 stars,JamesE,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,6
B0979PC8DJ,Dell-Latitude-5414-Rugged-14,dropping my rating,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","Update - Been a few weeks since I first used the laptop but today I wanted to install some additional software.  It's a BUST, B and N keys no longer work.  So, this laptop worked for approximately four hours and now, unless I can figure how to get the B and N keys to work, it's a door stop.Up front I wanted to say it's my fault.  I was looking for a small rugged Windows computer to use with a few mechanic programs - mainly ForScan.  Since I would take it while traveling it had to be tough, resistant to dust, not too heavy, and a screen I could see in sunlight.  This Dell has almost all of my needs - it is definitely tough.  It has dust ports covering everything.  It appears the battery and perhaps HHD are also accessible from each side.  I'm guessing it's the battery and HHD but with no manual, I could be wrong.  I used the Dell for the first time yesterday and after an long setup time; not blaming the Dell but trying to get through Windows caused me to reboot the laptop three times when Microsoft froze.  After setup and some personal software installed, I used the Dell on battery for about 90-mins without issue.  Sitting in my truck with the sun beating in, I was able to read the screen and that was a good thing.  My only issue and it's my fault, is the Dell is larger than I was expecting.  Of course it is heavy - given it's design and construction that wasn't a surprise and since it's in my truck 90% of the time or on my work bench, I don't think the weight will be a problem.  So, after just 48-hrs of use, we are happy.  Getting ready for a four month overlanding adventure and the Dell is going along, so we'll see if I need to update my review.",1.0 out of 5 stars,bluesy,,Verified Purchase,1,6

Only the laptop in the box, no charge on the laptop and no charging cord to turn it on. Maybe I'm crazy to assume that should come in the box with the laptop. I'll search for a charging cord and maybe, just maybe amazon forgot to include it and they'll overnight it to me. On the positive side it's well built, my HP was held together with gorilla glue and my 4 month old Dell cracked on the screen and it's held together with clamps so I opted for a rugged Dell and already I'm disappointed. Maybe we should bring manufacturing back to America to get quality item. That foreign stuff ain't impressing me much.  ""UPDATE""- I contacted the company and they sent my cord right out, I bought this because my new laptop case fell apart at 3 months old, this rugged case should last and last. It doesn't have 10 key, but I can live with that. Laptop is functioning well and it's very sturdy so I am very happy now.

Having recently acquired a refurbished model of this laptop, I can say with confidence that its performance and value are simply incomparable.First off, the durability of the Latitude 7390 is truly commendable. Despite being refurbished, the build quality is superb, rivaling and even surpassing many brand-new laptops on the market. This is a laptop designed for longevity, capable of withstanding daily use over extended periods without a hitch.The display quality of the Latitude 7390 deserves special mention. The sharp, vibrant visuals elevate everyday tasks, transforming ordinary browsing, streaming, or working sessions into an enjoyable experience. For those who prioritize display quality, this laptop will not disappoint.In terms of performance, the Latitude 7390 does more than just get the job done—it excels at it. Whether you're multitasking with numerous apps, browsing heavy websites, or running demanding software, this laptop maintains a smooth, lag-free operation, significantly boosting your productivity.Perhaps the most appealing aspect of the Latitude 7390 is the value it offers. When compared to brand-new laptops, which can cost twice as much, the superior quality and performance of this refurbished model make it an absolute steal. It's a testament to the fact that a hefty price tag doesn't always equate to better quality or performance.In conclusion, if you're considering investing in a laptop, I highly recommend giving the refurbished Dell Latitude 7390 a chance.

The laptop up to this day has refused to charge at all. It has to be kept plugged in at all times to be used which means you can't be mobile with it. The issue was reported and nothing has been done. Not even a refund!!! to get the issue fixed. The seller refused to refund me unless I sent the laptop back to them and would not even offer to cover the international shipping cost. Amazon declined my claim against the seller for a refund so I am left with a defective laptop which I have to pay out of pocket to have it checked, buying whatever part that needs to be repaired and pay to have it repaired.

B08LDY37P7,Latest_Dell-Generation-Processor-Bluetooth-HDMI%EF%BC%8CWindow,Great refurbished laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2023","So far I like everything about this renewed laptop.. It is like new. I had a 11.6"" laptop and this 13.3"" laptop is just barely larger even though the screen is 15% larger. This laptop is 11.93"" X 8.19 X .66"" compared to 11.5"" X 7.90"" X .75"" for the old laptop. The bezel is very narrow on this PC. This laptop weighs 3/4LB less than the old one. This PC is also a much faster, Quad core compared to Dual and has more Ram and storage. The display is very nice, FHD. I use this laptop almost all day, so I leave it plugged in. It has a much larger power connection and is much more rugged. On my old laptop, the power connection was very small and weak and the power would keep going out, which meant I could not use or charge it. Buying this laptop is like getting a brand new $1500 laptop for $200. Not sure about the battery since I don't use it on battery much. I guess we will see.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dale A.

B095MHPM4V,Dell-Latitude-5300-13-3-Touchscreen,Solid Laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2024","Right up front, I'm reviewing a Dell Latitude 5300 2-in-1 with an I7, and I am vendor-agnostic.  The unit that I'm reviewing came from a recent Woot! purchase, which may or may not reflect the vendor in this thread.The laptop that I received was marketed as ""scratch and dent"" but was, in fact, cosmetically flawless.The only complaint I would have is that that the battery was:A) low-capacity andB) 3 years oldLithium-Ion batteries only survive ~500 full charge cycles, which for must users works out to about 2 years of service.  In this case, the service tag for the system I received told me the laptop is/was just shy of 3 years old.  I would expect the battery to be shot , and a cost-saving measure refurbishers are unlikely to replace shot batteries.At the age and price-point of these systems, you should assume that you'll need to incur the extra cost of a new battery.  Additionally, the replacement long-capacity battery for this laptop is both cheap and super easy to replace if you have the correct screwdriver.The laptop itself legitimately runs Windows 11, is fast, and features an amazing touch screen.  Additionally, the system is easily upgraded to 32GB of RAM in addition to pretty much the NVME drive of your capacity choice.If you're willing to make the effort to replace the battery, this purchase is a no-brainer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,kc_shutterbug,3 people found this helpful,,1,6

B095MHPM4V,Dell-Latitude-5300-13-3-Touchscreen,Great Bang for the Buck!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2023","The good:Did a lot if searching and this seemed to be the best option for the price. Bought fir mynikdest who is going off to college soon and didn't want to spend 2k so went this route instead. With an i7, 16 gigs or RAM, and a 522Gb M.2 hard drive, it's gotbokenty of juice for her computing and digital art needs. Had to drop another $80 on a Dell stylus but well worth it.The Bad:Although it does come with 16Gb of SK Hynix DDR4 RAM, it's in the firm of a single DIMM instead of 2 which limits the speed and performance a bit as single Chanel memory. The battery seems to go pretty fast. I'm guessing it's the original battery and for the price it's fine. A new Delk replacement is less than $75 so that's ojay too when the time is needed.The 1st one we received had 4 golf ball sized anomalies on the screen in the firm of dark patches. Returned to get a perfect one back so no issues there. I'd just keep an eye out for this. sSince it is a 2 in 1, the screen was pretty important to my daughter since she'll be using it for her digital art among other screen intensive workloads. So keep your eyes peeked incase you get the same.To Sum it Up:It's a great buy for the price and both the memory and M.2 hard drive can be upgraded easily by unscrewing the 10 permanently attached screws on the back cover. 2 DDR4 Memory DIMM slots and 1 M.2 slot available for upgrades.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Maias Music,3 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,6

Whether it's web browsing, document editing, or streaming content, the processor ensures smooth operation. The included storage capacity is sufficient for basic needs, but users with heavier storage requirements might consider external options.The 15.6"" display offers crisp visuals and decent color reproduction, making it suitable for both work and entertainment purposes. The audio quality is adequate for casual use, but for a more immersive experience, external speakers or headphones are recommended.Battery life is respectable, providing enough juice for a full day of moderate usage. However, heavy tasks or gaming may drain the battery more quickly, so it's advisable to keep the charger handy for demanding activities.On the downside, the laptop could benefit from additional ports for increased connectivity options. While it covers the basics, users requiring multiple peripherals may find themselves using a USB hub.In conclusion, the Lenovo 15.6"" Laptop is a solid performer for everyday use. It strikes a good balance between affordability and functionality, making it a suitable choice for users seeking a reliable laptop for general tasks.",,محمد نذير,7 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,6

B08VKNVDDR,Acer-A515-46-R14K-Quad-Core-Processor-Backlit,Cuts all the right corners,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2021","No one feature is exceptional, but the amount of features/quality at the sub-400 price is impressive.❧ Solid construction, aluminum lid❧ Modern (at time of purchase) and moderately-well-equipped Ryzen APU❧ IPS screen with good max and min brightness, even backlight, and acceptable color rendition❧ Backlit Keyboard with a great layout and good key quality❧ Large, responsive trackpad with a turn-off option in the function keys❧ Good cooling solution for the size❧ User accessible / upgradable parts❧ Acceptable I/O (USB, HDMI, LAN, headphone jack, kensington)Corners that were cut:❧ Storage size - 128gb DRAM-less SSD as configured❧ Win 10 in S mode (I believe Microsoft charges less for the ""s"" license)❧ Speakers are truly terrible. I cannot overemphasize how bad they are.❧ Ram Size - 4gb DDR4 2400❧ No card reader❧ 1 year warranty (remember when things actually had 2 or 3???)❧ No Mic jackThe storage is upgradeable. The included SSD is user-replaceable, and there is also an included space /  hardware to add a 2.5"" drive. The 4gb RAM is built in to the board, but there is one slot open for RAM. Having filled mine, CPU-Z reports that it is successfully running in dual channel mode (important for APU memory bandwidth).It strikes me that the corners cut are ALL user-addressable. Windows 10 can leave S mode. Ram/storage is upgradeable. Card readers and external speakers/headphones/audio interfaces can be used.The 3350u processor has a manufacturer-configurable TDP, which affects its boost clock behavior. This one seems to be configured to a relatively medium-low power. I have never seen it boost past 3.1ghz (the AMD spec sheet lists a 3.5 ghz max). Fine by me, but worth noting. The cooling solution seems like it could handle more, but it does dump heat primarily beneath it (i.e. into your lap if you are using it as a laptop literally). I don't really blame them for dialing it back for this reason or to hit battery life targets.After adding RAM and storage, I have successfully done some medium gaming at low settings. Civ 6, Life is Strange 2, and the infamously-processor-bound-poorly-optimized Guild Wars 2. All fine, but I would have gotten something more powerful if I didn't have a gaming desktop.My last laptop was from 2009 and lasted me 'til 2021. The hardware on this one should meet my needs for equally long -- all that's left to be seen is if anything randomly breaks between now and then. If any random breakage occurs between now and 2023 I will update this review.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pea A Bee,12 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,6
B08VKNVDDR,Acer-A515-46-R14K-Quad-Core-Processor-Backlit,Fast snappy machine for cheap.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2021","Fast and simple setup, wifi connection strong and fast.  Not overloading with shovelware, has a decent variety of utilities and software, most of which looks reasonable for the typical pc user.Havent tested for gaming, and don't plan to on anything modern/4k, mostly emulation which shouldn't burden it too much.  Intergrated graphics has enough power to run background apps for any upscaled emulation to 1080p, but I wouldnt try and run anything like twitch simultaneously.  I plan on using it lightly, some work, some low key gaming, and for the price it makes sense.  A great laptop for students, its a good size with enough umph for your educational needs, or if you're bored.Design is great, feels very solid, keyboard is great, fingerprint sensor actually works (i do construction and my hands get wrecked all the time, this a big deal for me).Sync'd with my phone super easy in under 5 minutes, porting my google account and contacts no problem!I'd highly recommend for someone that wants a great machine for an awesome price.  I'm not saying it has all the power in the world, or storage, or biggest battery, but for the price you'll be greatly impressed with how the specs shine on this laptop.  Also impressively thin, and hasn't really gotten above a warm temp.  Solid state usually helps greatly with this, as all laptops use these now.Overall I highly recommend, and this would also be the perfect backup laptop for travel or to carry daily and not worry about something happening to it and cost you a grand.  Mac users could find this as a viable pc option to meet their non-Mac needs.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kyle,4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,6
B08VKNVDDR,Acer-A515-46-R14K-Quad-Core-Processor-Backlit,Best in it's price range,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2021","I'm not an acer fan, as acer was like the hyundai's of the pc tech world in my book, but I needed a laptop for my daughter and this one fit the bill.So far so good, I'd say build quality is fairly decent, it's slimmer than I expected. Performance wise, obviously it's no beast, but it gets the job done. What's really great about this is the fact that the ram is upgradeable to 64GB, but I'll just purchase an 8GB stick to add to it.There is room for a 2.5"" SSD. The NVME is also removeable, so while there's no sd card slot, storage is fully expandable in a better way.Having a backlit keyboard with #pad is excellent.Webcam quality is ok, nothing to talk about there, 720p 30fps max, but as mentioned before, gets the job done.Even with only 4Gb Ram, it still ran smoothly despite having several Chrome windows open with multiple tabs. Installed minecraft java edition for her, it was able to play set at 7 chunks render distance, and not very many settings dialed down and still get 60fps (not that she cared about fps), so I still think you may be able to play some titles at 720p maybe medium settings, but i haven't checked it yet.Screen is not bad, viewing angles are quite good and bright enough.The speaker are not loud but audio quality is fairly decent, especially given how slim the laptop is. Your phone may go louder, but it won't scrape your ear canal.Battery life is average I'd say.All in all, this is a laptop that is more expensive than it should be, AS ARE ALL THAT FALL IN THIS PRICE POINT, but definitely compared against all the others I've sifted through, it's the best. In summary, it is because:1. Ability to upgrade internal nvme storage + add 2.5"" ssd2. As with internal storage, ram isn't soldered on like the other brand laptops and can be upgraded3. Latest WiFi and Bluetooth technology4. Backlit keyboard with number pad and fingerprint scanner on touchpad5. Inclusion of an ethernet port. Especially helpful if you need a stable internet connection.6. Windows 11 ready7. Decent display with good viewing angles8. Decent quad core apu9. USB-C also available on chassis and overall, decent I/OIt's a solid buy if you're looking for a laptop within it's price range at the time of this review.

B08VKNVDDR,Acer-A515-46-R14K-Quad-Core-Processor-Backlit,Absolutely amazing for price,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2021","For $350, I expect a laptop that's basically a piece of junk, and this completely exceeded my expectations. I'm just a college student and don't need anything fancy, and obviously also don't have a ton of money to spend on electronics. I'm more than happy with this computer. I saw some people complain about the screen quality, as well as the speakers and the touchpad, but honestly I haven't noticed an issue with any of them at all. The screen quality is a little less than my old laptop but I don't notice it really, if you're into gaming and stuff it might be annoying but for daily use and movie watching I think it's good, once again you are getting more than what you're paying for in the first place. It's relatively light, has lots of outlets which I always appreciate. The speakers are just fine for me, the loudest I've ever put them is at 50% volume, so in my opinion they're plenty loud enough. The trackpad has never given me any issue so far. The S Mode thing is annoying, but easy to disable, even though I haven't done that yet and honestly might not because I'm just a casual user and it isn't a huge deal to me. All in all, I'm very impressed at the quality, considering how low the price is. This is absolutely the best thing you're gonna find for this price range. I'm really glad that I went with my gut and picked this laptop over the Lenovo one that I was considering. My last Chromebook that I loved and lasted me four years was Acer, and I decided to go ahead and stick with Acer since I trust the brand and they're known for making great durable products for cheap, which is what I wanted. If you're looking for something high end and fancy, this isn't for you, but if you want the cheapest laptop possible with the most capabilities possible, then this is what you want to get.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Audryn,5 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,6
B08VKNVDDR,Acer-A515-46-R14K-Quad-Core-Processor-Backlit,After a year and a half with my daughter at college,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022","I am looking for a new “pay the bills, turbotax, light excel, occasional stream” laptop. Remembered I had bought this exact one for my daughter when she began college fall semester of 2021.I am definitely going to buy this same laptop for the above noted uses. It has survived the abuse of my somewhat klutzy  (also beautiful, confident, talented and intelligent) daughter’s device abuse habits for almost two years now and still functions and looks like new with a “forever” battery life.Helpful tip passed to me by a savvy friend of mine…Acer’s are simple to upgrade. He convinced me to buy this model along with an extra Solid State hard-drive and stick of RAM. All in it cost less than $500. The resulting specs, with the exception of processor speed, could not be found for less than $1,100 on any laptop I saw at the time we purchased this one. The processor along with the memory is absolutely fast enough for anything other than intense, gaming, CAD, etc.Go for it!Was able to get the hard-drive and RAM at the local Best Buy…these are readily available components at Amazon and most likely a local electronics store, if there is one, near you. With the above noted upgrades and anticipated uses- this is a terrific laptop and I recommend it highly for value and performance - it is sturdy, easy to use, and has a long battery life…not sure what else you could need.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lawrence Alpharetta,6 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,6
B08VKNVDDR,Acer-A515-46-R14K-Quad-Core-Processor-Backlit,Everything I need and more,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2021","My Gateway laptop has been getting slower and slooowwwwer for a while to the point where it took me (no exaggeration) 15 minutes to boot...and it was getting glitchy besides.  I've had Acers before and they've been good machines so I thought I'd give this one a shot.  I'm not in the least disappointed.  The pros:+The backlit keyboard.  I absolutely love it.  Yes, the backlighting goes off after a few seconds of non use - but any key will immediately turn it back on.  So I just press the Shift key and the backlighting returns.  A really neat feature on such an inexpensive computer.+The matte finish screen.  I remember when I was searching for my last laptop that I had a terribly hard time finding a matte (non-glare) screen.  It seemed that at that time for some inexplicable reason every manufacturer out there had gone to a glossy screen which, to me, creates thoroughly unacceptable reflections.  The Gateway I wound up with was one of the very few on the market with a matte screen.  So glad this one has it as well.+Flexibility.  Apparently it is quite easy to upgrade both the memory and the hard drive.  For my uses I don't think I'll need to do either one - but it's nice to know I can if I want to.  I've been using a 1TB external drive as my primary storage for some time now, so I just plugged it in and kept on chugging.+Speed.  I know I was transitioning from a computer that had become outrageously slow, but I was not prepared for boot times under ten seconds - wow!  It's about time that these things finally are operating at speeds they should have been all along.  And everything is much faster.  It is a true pleasure.+Design.  Sleek, clean, not all gimmicked up.  And although I read a review or two that said the fan was noisy I think those reviewers got a clunker because mine is super quiet - you can barely hear the fan at all.  Certainly not anywhere near as noisy as my previous laptop.The cons:- I do wish it had a DVD drive built in.  I know it would have made it thicker, but I hate that I won't be able to access some of my antique stuff until I add one.  Oh, well.And that's it for the cons.  I find this to be an outstanding computer for the price and would highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't need eyeball-searing speed and massive memory capacities necessary for some genres.

Everything was great for the first couple years minus the cursor disappearing a few times. 5 days ago I was going thru emails before paying bills and the screen went black.

Decided I didn't want the hassle of choosing a new laptop and trying to figure out all my login info for everything. So I contacted a local guy who repairs computers. Heard back from him yesterday and sure enough the screen died. $250 is what I'm paying him to fix it.

It has a ""regular"" touchpad with 2 buttons.- look and feel. Not bad. It has a decent quality plastic case - which doesn't feel rock solid, but doesn't feel woefully cheap either.What's bad.- battery. Lasts for 2 hours, not more.

B08T6N424Z,Lenovo-Chromebook-11-6-Inch-Processor-82HG0006US,First Chromebook and it's a winner,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2022","First off, the touchscreen works fine.  I'm on version 100.0.4896.133 and had absolutely no issues.  So whatever plagued this model previously has been resolved.  Now then, lets focus on the laptop.The first thing I noticed was the screen.  In an age of almost no bezels....  Holy bezel Batman!  Is this a bad thing?  Eh, maybe to some.  For me I'm OK with it.  Realize the laptop itself is about the size of a 13.3"" laptop.  I haven't looked into it but I suspect there's a laptop in this chassis with a 12"" or 13"" screen.  But in day-to-day use, it's fine for me.  The smaller screen gives a good pixel density and colors look fine.  Very good viewing angles too.  So all in all, I like it.  Touchscreen seems very responsive as well.  No issues at all there.  Oh, and in the bezel there's a webcam.  720p, does OK in low light, no physical shutter so get your stickers ready :PGoing down the laptop we have the hinge.  While I'm not a fan of tablet modes that leave the keyboard exposed, it does what it sets out to do just fine.  The pivoting action feels very smooth with a fair bit of resistance.  Folding over into tablet mode, everything works as expected with good orientation control.  So while something I won't use much, it's a nice feature.Down further, we get to the keyboard.  Keys have a nice feel to them though travel is a bit short.  Not Lenovo's best but certain better than other keyboard I've used.  I'm a little disappointed it doesn't include the usual ""F"" keys given I use Linux on here but so far it's not caused any issues...Finally we come to the touchpad.  I must be honest, I despise most any touchpad without physical buttons.  However, I must confess this one is actually very good.  It's proven to be very responsive with almost no hiccups.  At times I will have a small lag if I try and use two fingers (resting one finger on the ""button"" and moving with the other) but it handles this better than other cheap machines I've dealt with.  The physical action is rather mushy but taps work just as well.Finally, we come to the speakers.  This is probably the weakest part of the whole machine.  I find underside speakers become obstructed way too often.  Of course this depends on how it's used, but I'd much prefer top-mounted speakers.  But judging what we have, they actually works pretty well.  If you're on a hard surface, they have decent sound.  Nothing phenomenal, but about what you'd expect from a machine at this price point.  And then if they are covered, you can still get OK sound from them.I guess the last point will be I/O.  Charging is via USB-C, and yes, this port can be used for other USB devices too.  You also have full-sized HDMI, a USB 3.0 and full-sized SD card slot.  SD cards aren't flush when inserted so that's a bit disappointing, but I'm glad Lenovo at least opted for full sized ports and such.  Now on the adjacent side we have power, volume and a headphone jack...not much to say there.Finally the guts of the beast.  At the heart of this machine is an ARM based processor.  I was very curious how performance would be using ChromeOS and more importantly the Linux dev environment.  Results have been mixed but generally very good.  As a Chromebook for surfing the web and watching videos, it works fine.  Pages load quickly, videos play without issue, etc.  The only hiccup I've found is playing a video in the background.  The video remains frozen for a bit when returning to it, but this is only a minor quibble.  I've not had many issues with Android apps either.  My library is really only productivity software, but it's all worked as expected.  Over on the Linux side, the processor is a bit labored.  Chromium under Linux is obviously slower than the baked in Chrome, but I'm sure Linux running as a VM doesn't help.Lets end on usage, or more specifically heat and battery life.  I've not done any specific testing, but I'd say 10 hours out of this machine wouldn't be difficult at all.  And then even while under a load and charging, there's almost no noticeable heat generated by this laptop.If you're looking for a good all around Chromebook and can overlook the oddly sized screen, I highly recomend this machine!",5.0 out of 5 stars,D.

B08T6N424Z,Lenovo-Chromebook-11-6-Inch-Processor-82HG0006US,Great quality! Built to last! Excellent Computer!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023","I bought this computer when it was first released in 2021. So I've had it just about 3 years now. It's works just as great as the day it arrived. It's an excellent computer, built to last, and works perfect for everything and anything I've ever needed it for over the years from online school to running a business and everything in between.I really enjoy the touch screen feature. It's not something I use very often, but it's pretty handy. The transition from laptop to tablet is very smooth especially if you are working on a program that can use both. (I mostly use it for cricut and Netflix). I've never had any problems or noticed any lag in the screen when swapping over.I play a few online game and it keeps up no problem. I have never had a lagging or loading issue. Also nice that I can download the apps I have on my phone onto the computer. When I'm on the road working everything stays connected and it's no hassle to pull up work files and programs when I get back to the computer.Its a pretty touch little machine and can handle just about anything you throw at it. I'm a general contractor and sometimes my computer has to go onto jobs sights with me. Often not a place you would want to bring a computer for risk of damaging it. But this computer can take a beating. It has fallen several times while it was open and had several things land on it while it was closed. This computer is a beast! It was definitely built tough and built to last!The battery is amazing! It says 10 hours, however that's not true. I'm on my computer every day usually all day with multiple programs open and running. It stays charged the entire day and often has battery the next morning when I forget to plug it in over night. I'd say you can easily get close 14-18 hours of battery life on a single charger. That's pretty impressive especially since mine is a few years old now.The sound quality and volume is plenty for me. I don't think I've ever had it on max volume. It's nice that is has the volume buttons in 2 locations: on the keyboard and on the side of the device. It's has an AUX/headphone port, but in this day and age I've never needed to use it. I mostly connect external speakers via the Bluetooth capability. Very easy to do!The only downside is the lack of ports. 1 USB drive isnt always enough. I use a wireless mouse when I'm on the computer so that takes care of the 1 USB drive. No biggie normally the mouse is the only thing I have connect to it but in the off chance I need to plug something else in, I ordered a cheap USB splitter and that works just fine.Overall this computer is a really great buy! I do not think you would be disappointed in your choice if you decided to go this route. I know I definitely have not been. This computer should be able to meet all of your needs for many many years!",5.0 out of 5 stars,StevenYoung,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

B08T6N424Z,Lenovo-Chromebook-11-6-Inch-Processor-82HG0006US,"Great Chromebook, but not what I had ordered.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2022","This Chromebook is a really good laptop.  The price point was excellent, and it is a lightweight, solidly built Chromebook that sips on the battery instead of drinking or gulping it.  An individual can expect to get a full day's use on a single battery charge.I love the touch screen, 2-in-1 feature (tablet/tent or laptop, the sound is adequate, the keyboard size is good, and the weight is great particularly for adding minimal weight in a backpack.  There is a mechanical slide built in to physically block the camera, which is a particularly nice feature.  It uses a USB-C adapter, which is helpful for possibly being able to carry/manage multiple cords.  It is compact enough to be carried in nearly any size backpack, messenger bag, or medium to large handbag.On the right side of the computer, there is a power button, rocker volume button, and Kensington lock input.  On the left side, there is a micro-SD slot, a 3.5 mm headphone/microphone input, a USB-A input, and a USB-C power input.  I wish there were either one more USB-C input or a second USB-A input; however, a USB-C mini hub (probably one with a power pass through) will provide additional inputs for any USB accessories needed.  This is a minor complaint, but not enough to deduct a star.I did, however, deduct one star because I specifically wanted AND ordered a laptop in white.  That is not what I received.  (I received one that is dark navy.)  I didn't return it because I didn't want to pay a restocking fee, and ultimately it meets every other expectation I had for a new Chromebook.If you don't mind the random act of receiving a Chromebook in a different color than what was expected, this Chromebook is a good, solid item with a beast of a battery in a compact, lightweight footprint.  it will provide hours and hours of surfing and streaming.  It will be good for using the Google suite of items.  It is a great laptop for a student, and it is a great laptop for a work if one's work is largely web-based.This is what this computer is not:  it is not a Windows PC system; it is a Chromebook.  It is not a large computer.  If you want a screen larger than 11.6 inches, this laptop is not for you.  I am not a gamer, so I can't speak to its ability to run games.",4.0 out of 5 stars,F. L.

B08T6N424Z,Lenovo-Chromebook-11-6-Inch-Processor-82HG0006US,Great Affordable Chromebook,"Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2021","I purchased this Chromebook to have a portable laptop for work.The positives:-I love the size & color-It's lightweight-The keyboard is comfortable to type with-The battery life is outstanding.-The 2 in 1 feature is very neat.-Ability to personalize some of the settings similar to a Mac-It starts right up-The OS speed is fast-Google Play works just fine-It's a great overall Chromebook if you are looking for an affordable option!The downsides:-To me are the display screen is small for the size of the screen. Lenovo could have made the display screen at least an inch wider and an inch higher without making the dimensions of the laptop larger and that would have helped the overall display significantly. It will probably be an improvement on a future model.-I didn't do a video call, only took a picture and the camera quality doesn't seem to be the best, so if you are relying on this for lots of work zoom calls, you may want to find something with a clearer camera, though it will certainly work.-The speakers are very low quality. It's not horrible, but compared to most technology right now it's on the lower end, for sure. If you mostly use a bluetooth speaker or earbuds to listen to music or watch movies this is no problem.-The mouse pad feels a little cheap to me. This is a $250 laptop, so it's expected to feel cheap somewhere, but just something to note.-If you prefer to use Brave as your browser for privacy & security like I do, it is glitchy. This could perhaps be fixed with an update to that app.I am used to Macbooks, so this definitely feels like a downgrade to me, but for the price it's a good deal in my opinion!Unfortunately the touchscreen on my Chromebook did not work. It could be the recent Chrome OS update that other reviews have suggested, so I will be returning mine because that was a feature I was most excited about at this price point. Amazon customer service took great care of me with this, supplying an option for a refund or exchange, even when Lenovo didn't answer and eventually dropped my call to get product support for this issue.In the end, I personally will not buy this product for work again. I would buy it if I was looking for an inexpensive option for school, wanting a laptop/tablet for my child, doing a lot of traveling and not wanting to put an expensive laptop at risk of being damaged, or just wanted something cheaper to watch movies on. For a primary work laptop I personally need something with a slightly bigger/clearer screen and a better camera for video calls.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Lesley,3 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

B0BSHV6JV1,Lenovo-IdeaPad-Flex-Touchscreen-Fingerprint,Little on the heavy side but good otherwise,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2023","Purchased the Ideapad Flex 5 16"" R7-512GB laptop version while it was on sale on Prime Day for $699. So far I am overall happy with this unit. The screen quality is very good for a lower to mid budget laptop and colors are vibrant enough. Touchscreen works great as well. I like the idea of the flexibility of changing between laptop mode and tablet mode. The 16"" screen size in tablet mode is great for watching movies and other random entertaining things, but if your goal is to use it for note taking or similar, it is a little on the larger side and would recommend the 14"" instead.  My main purpose is to use it for travels and remote work via remote desktop, so the additional real estate on the screen was important for me for my engineering work (CAD and programming).Since I also have a need for multiple monitors when stationary, I went ahead and also purchased a cheap off-brand USB-C docking station from Falwedi on Amazon. I was able to expand to at least 2 additional monitors, resulting in a triple monitor setup, one 24"" Dell 1080 and another 27"" Dell 2K. I did however get some issues where the external monitors would blank for a second or two occasionally, but not yet sure if this was due to the current drivers on the Ideapad or the off-brand docking station. Something I will need to investigate further at a later time.Sound quality from the speakers is just ok. There is no base, which I wouldn't expect from a lower budget laptop anyways. The camera worked decently and clear, which is sufficient for most video conferences anyways.The fingerprint reader works flawlessly and makes login into Windows and other biometric supporting apps super easy.I am however surprised on how heavy this unit is for being a new modern 16"" model. Reminds me of my 10+ year old Toshiba brick. Another drawback is that the pen or stylus was not included with it and is sold separately.There is no ethernet port and for those that want to utilize wired connections, will need to purchase an additional dongle.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pita,21 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

B0BSHV6JV1,Lenovo-IdeaPad-Flex-Touchscreen-Fingerprint,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024",This is a piece of garbage.  When I first bought it it started to overheat soooo much that it actually hurt to touch it.  The fan would run constantly and I couldn't turn the laptop off.  I had to wait for it to die. I literally couldnt leave it alone because I was afraid it was going to start a fire.  I had a friend look at it and it seemed like we fixed the problem.  A few months after that it stopped holding a charge.  I homeschool my child and it sometimes feels like we spend more time trying to get this pos to work than actual homeschooling.  I have now had this laptop for about 8 months and it has started to get EXTREMELY hot again.  It barely holds a charge now.  We might get one hour worth of charge at a time.  The only way my child can really use it is when it is plugged in and when we're done with school we HAVE to unplug it right away. We have also had problems with the touch pad and touch screen intermittently.  This laptop was a huge mistake and waste of money.  I wish I never bought it.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Brandon W,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7
B0BSHV6JV1,Lenovo-IdeaPad-Flex-Touchscreen-Fingerprint,Best laptop I've ever had,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2024","I'm a techie, professionally and hobby wise, and I've had so many flavors of laptops and desktops. This right here though, is one awesome piece of equipment. Specs are very nice. I dual boot between Fedora and Windows 11, I run applications for different projects at the same time and there is no freezing or memory clogs. Even when practicing pen testing, the Ryzen has more threads than the Intels I'm used to using, so it works on more processes, much faster than it's Intel equivalent (Ryzen 5 vs i5, etc) Pretty lightweight, light up keyboard is perfect.

B0BSHV6JV1,Lenovo-IdeaPad-Flex-Touchscreen-Fingerprint,Truly this is a great laptop for the price.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2022","To clarify, I have the 16GB RAM/512GB SSD/ Ryzen 5 5500U model.  The battery life, camera quality, touch screen, and the power of this laptop are exactly what they should be for this price range. The speed and power of the laptop is what has impressed me the most. I am a music producer and I need at least 16GB of Ram and the 512GB of storage is pretty good as well. I also like to game a little. I was able to download and install over 60GB of musical software, which would usually take me a whole day or two to fully set up, in about 30 minutes. I am able to play Fortnite at around 30-40 fps, Valorant at around 60-80 fps, and Minecraft at around 60+ fps, which is plenty for my own needs right now, as I mostly use it for music production. So far it runs everything I bought it for smoothly and has at least met, if not exceeded my expectations. After reading many of the worse reviews, I tried to prepare myself for some flaws, but I honestly like everything about it. The brightness isn’t as bad as some people say either, 250 nits on this display is honestly plenty for probably 90% of the situations I use it in. Even if there is sunlight, I can still see the screen enough. It’s not like I’ll be gaming in the sunlight, if anything doing a musical performance outside during the day would potentially be a challenge but not impossible. Overall if you are someone who needs a good laptop for a good price, this really is a good choice. It’s my first time using Lenovo as I have used HP for 8+ years. I’m very impressed",5.0 out of 5 stars,Josh Grimes,58 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

B0BXRD41GM,ASUS-Vivobook-Display-Processor-E1504FA-AS52,Nice,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024","I’ve owned this laptop for two months so far. Here’s what I love: It’s light weight. And it does what we all pray our laptop will do. Work. Every time we open it. It doesn’t get overheated unless I’m working on bed right on my comforter. Yeah I know: don’t do that. And most often I don’t. But I will say even when I do, it’s doesn’t get screaming hot. And of course I move it best I can to keep the vents free.And the battery is amazing. I work for hours on end before it poops out. It boots up fairly quickly and operates without hardly a drag and I’m creating graphic elements and so forth inside of Canva. So, she’s quick. Not lightning, but this is under $500 soooo since that is the case, I’d say, wow, nice on speed!The two bummers are: no lighted keyboard. But, I’m surviving. And then there’s the screen. Don’t get me wrong. It’s got a beautiful picture. The drag is that the angle of preciousness is tricky to land on. When you tilt it exactly where it needs to be you see a clear and amazing picture of what ever you’re looking at. But have it off a bit and well, the colors and so forth are not accurate. The screen has what I’ve taken to call a shadow across it. I don’t know what it’s called when a screen does this and I don’t even care to look the term up. But, when it happens I must mess with the angle so I can see it without it being dark.I’m thankful I could get into a laptop at all because money was not there to get one any better. I just wish that screen wouldn’t be such a bugger bear to get right. I work with graphics/color a ton so to me it matters.However, all said, I’d buy it again and resolve to just deal with the screen. And if you were to ask me, and it would seem you are since you’re reading this review, if you need a laptop and don’t have much to spend this baby will deliver everything you need it to do. Which is to work. And end of day, we all need our laptops to work.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Theresa Jane,5 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

It was also very quick to respond as I surfed the net.  However, things went downhill pretty quickly.  I began to get blue screens when I tried to boot up the laptop.  It would say that there was some kind of error and it would go into repair mode.  Over and over and over again. It is now September of 2021 (a mere 5 months after the purchase date) and I have already had to pay for a visit to our local PC repair shop where they had to re-install Windows.  That fixed things for about a month but then the same problems started up again.  The laptop currently goes into loops of blue screens and doesn't even open Windows.  I sit here writing this review on my old dinosaur of a Lenovo laptop which, sadly, now works better than my brand new laptop (which actually doesn't work at all since it goes straight to blue screens whenever I try to boot it up).

B08NFDW4JS,Lenovo-IdeaPad-Non-Touch-Dual-Core-i3-1005G1,The hardware is from year 2019 and the RAM memory is soldered.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2022","I purchased the IdeaPad (IP) laptop because it had two interesting hardware parts:a) A solid disk NVMe characterized by working at high speed.b) An Intel Quad Core processor.It came with the latest Windows OS installed.If you check the product in the Amazon advertisement, you will note the following details:— There is no information about model.— The seller says it has 4 GB RAM but doesn’t tell you it is on board soldered hardware.— There is no information about an Ethernet port.The laptop arrived on time and in good conditions.  After charging the battery, I proceeded with the setup.The first surprise was the IP did not have an Ethernet port, which come standard in almost every computer.  It was very difficult to use my Wi-Fi, located about 3 feet from the laptop.  In the middle of the process, it got frozen and there was not a way to start from the beginning.  After some time trying to find out a solution, it came to my mind to do a hard reset.  Then I pushed the power button for some seconds and that was the method to start the process (Not a word from Lenovo, Microsoft or the seller how to do that).After finishing the setup, I wanted to register the product. I looked for the Command Prompt. At this point, I have a second surprise.  W11 did not permit to install anything because it was a Windows S laptop.  This is a very important information the seller did not show in his ad. I was lucky that there was a button to get rid of the S mode and install the CMD. With CMD, I was able to find the product serial number.The laptop comes with Lenovo Vantage software preinstalled where you can find information about the hardware, warranty and many other things.  Lenovo showed that warranty for the IP started in September 2021 and will last until November 2022.  Therefore, I would have only 4 months of warranty!  That made me suspect the laptop was used and registered many months before, but I don’t have proof.After searching information of the hardware installed, I found the Intel N5030, and the SSD were versions from year 2019.  However, the advertising said it was a “new” Lenovo Idea Pad.While working with some applications, I noticed the system did not respond and took me a long time to do simple things with very elemental applications like Paint.This is a low power laptop good for text editors, sending emails and browsing. One good thing is that it is fan-less and very compact.SummaryI am returning this laptop because:a) There is no possibility to increase the memory.b) The hardware is about 2 years old.c) The system works slowly in most of the applicationsd) It has no Ethernet port",2.0 out of 5 stars,MANUEL S.,45 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

B081Q11FRB,HP-ProBook-650-G2-Bit-Multi-Language,Defective Product and Bad Customer Service,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2024","I recently had the displeasure of dealing with Olive Computers and my experience was far from satisfactory.I purchased an HP ProBook 650 G2 laptop from Olive Computers through Amazon. Upon receiving the item, it became evident that the charging port was defective. The device would charge intermittently. I returned the item to the vendor only to realize that the vendor claimed that nothing was wrong with the machine and only refunded $18.55 charging me $209 as a restocking fee for the item.I reached out to Amazon Customer Service on the matter and they in turn reached out to Olive Computers. I then received communication from Olive Computers that the item I returned was severely damaged and that it was an incorrect item returned, this is after charging me a restocking fee for the item, which didn’t make sense to me. Why charge a restocking fee if you realize that the item was not yours? I then realized that this vendor did not want to refund me for the item as they were now trying to stall the process and shifting blame. First, they said nothing was wrong with the item and charged a restocking fee, then they said it was a damaged item returned and then also claimed that the item was different from what they sold.What we see here is that they repeatedly shifted blame and refused to acknowledge their responsibility for the defective product. Instead of resolving the issue professionally, Olive Computers resorted to threatening language, implying that I was attempting fraud by seeking a refund for a damaged item. This behavior is unacceptable and reflects poorly on their business ethics.Despite my repeated attempts to reach a fair resolution, Olive Computers continues to evade accountability and fails to provide a satisfactory explanation for its actions.I also have an issue with how Amazon handled the incident. My first call to Amazon was on January 26th and I spent 30 minutes and 54 seconds on a call with them outlining the issue. They then reached out to Olive Computers to resolve the issue. Olive Computers continued to evade, so I reached out to Amazon again on Feb 4th and spent 10 minutes and 11 seconds on the phone again. They then sent an email to Olive Computers who again claimed that the item was damaged and that it wasn’t theirs and offered to return the item to me at my cost which I refused as since they were being dishonest in saying the item was not theirs, I didn’t trust them to return the item to me and I also didn’t believe that this was a proper resolution to the issue. I reached out to Amazon again on Feb 6th and spent 24 minutes and 12 seconds on the phone and the customer service representative advised that Amazon was going to file an A to Z claim on my behalf and I would hear back in 7 days, I also received an email to that effect. 7 days came and went and still no resolution, so I reached out to Amazon again on Feb 14th and spent 1 hour and 43 seconds on the phone as I asked to speak with a supervisor. He said there was no A to Z filed and since I had responded to the vendor's latest message it couldn’t be filed no but I would have to wait 24 hours. So after 24 hours, I reached out to Amazon again on Feb 16th and spent 27 minutes and 30 seconds on the phone with them. The customer service representative had issues putting in the A to Z claim and tried to walk me through the process of doing it myself which didn’t work because the item was already showing refunded. Amazon then told me they would escalate the matter to another team trained to handle these issues and I would hear from them within 7 days. I insisted that they put that in writing and an email was sent to me. After 7 days passed and no follow up I reached out to Amazon again on Feb 25th and spent 1 hour 4 minutes and 34 seconds on the phone with a supervisor who empathized with me but tried again to make a claim and then decided to again refer it to another Amazon team. To date, there is still no resolution of the issue with Amazon or Olive computers and I am now contemplating further actions.In conclusion, my experience with Olive Computers was marred by defective products, unprofessional conduct, baseless accusations, and a lack of accountability. In addition, Amazon has filed to be helpful in resolving this issue with the vendor. I strongly advise potential customers to refrain from purchasing from this vendor, as their business practices and customer service leave much to be desired.",1.0 out of 5 stars,griffiks,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

B08T6J8MZK,Lenovo-Thinkpad-1920x1080-Business-Thunderbolt,"Good enough for the price, I guess…","Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2023","I probably should have put this laptop thru its paces before now, and I might have actually returned it if I realized how poor the battery life was, and noticed the peculiar issue where the screen just sometimes goes black. I don’t necessarily blame the refurbishing QC, as the screen issue is intermittent - but the battery lasting barely an hour is something they should have noticed. Also; charge it all the way up, unplug it, and within a couple days you can’t even turn it on without plugging it back in - let alone try to use it on that charge. Now, it looks as good as new, physically, and has everything that it was advertised as including… but there is obviously still something wrong with it as evidenced from the screen blackouts (not power related or screen saver or anything like that) and poor, poor battery life. But since 99% of the time I’ll be using this at home; I’m okay with just leaving it plugged up all the time. So I dunno… I guess I just understand that refurbs will rarely be perfect, and I’m able to tolerate the issues mentioned due to the reduced price. Just temper your expectations - you very well could get a perfect one, but just know that both me and and friend that bought the same model on the same day both experienced some issues… his were big enough to return his, as he needed to rely on it on the road away from power.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Rubbertoe,3 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

The old Acer Chromebook powers off now whenever you insert a micro sd card. Then it needs to stay off for like 6 hours before you can use it again without it turning off after 15 seconds. I was hesitant about purchasing another Acer however after looking at many other manufacturers offerings those displays were small and blurry by comparison. I did get three years use out  of the old one without all of the update hassle and the old one had really great battery life.The new Acer 315 has a better keyboard ( with the DELETE key that was missing on the Acer 15) with a nice tactile feel.  The IPS display is great with a really wide viewing angle. The only thing I really miss using the the new Acer is I no longer have a back illuminated keyboard. That it turns out was a bigger deal than I thought. Videos play without problem. My Ethernet adapter is supported natively by the Acer and the Acer is one of the few models available with a display port out over USB C. Great for Nasa imagery that my Smart TV (that is no longer updated) refuses to display. So the Acer Chromebook is sort of pricey but has better portability, battery life, and a display that none of my Windows Laptops can compete with.

But Mediocre Battery Life for Multitaskers, Not Compatible with Most Powerbanks","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2024","Bought since it looked less flimsy than a skinny HP laptop that'd break after dropping, spent half its price repairing the monitor and it still broke a 2nd time after dropping again.It works pretty well, fast enough. The alternate trackpad and mouse buttons aren't that useful and I get them confused with the spacebar. The fingerprint sensor get inconsistent over time, but works generally.The battery life is not that impressive for what is advertised, at least when I use quite a few apps. I can get maybe 4 hours, even less when I was running looping python scripts in the background.Not for long-term outside use, like on roadtrips, and power banks won't work either because the higher voltage needed for the charger port. If you use it inside buildings near power outlets it'll be acceptable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Chris,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

Came in great condition, a few light scratches on the laptop but that is to be expected when you buy renewed.10th gen i7 still holds up really well. 16GB RAM is solid too. I am able to do everything I need to do for work and personal tasks. Very light and easy to walk around with. Touchscreen is a nice addition as well.My only complaint is that the Function and Ctrl keys are swapped compared to most other laptops/keyboards. I don't know why Lenovo does this. You can switch it in the BIOS but it's still weird.Overall this is a great work computer, I have not experienced any slowdown running my apps which are not too resource-intensive but not lightweight either.

B07YNHXX8D,New-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Touch-Screen,Great school tablet,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2020","I really like this Surface Pro 7. It is exactly as advertised with one exception. The battery life is nowhere near what is advertised. On battery saving mode, using only Onenote for taking class notes, it lasts about 4 hours. Fortunately it charges up very quickly though. I can't see any way that I would get a full days use out of a full battery charge in any circumstance. In my case that is not very important because I am always around an outlet but if you need a tablet that will last all day away from a power source you will have a problem. The camera is good enough, not as good as the Apple camera, but I don't really use it as a camera anyway. I use mostly the 365 programs and find that it integrates these programs seamlessly. Onenote comes with the tablet and has been an amazing app for my vet school classes.  It saves my many hours of study time. My only issues are with the instability of Onenote. It closes itself down every few minutes and is very frustrating. I'm sure there is a fix for this but I'm also sure that I won't get it from Microsorft as they have a technical support team that is on par with the customer service team at the cable company. I've contacted them 3 times now and my issue is never addressed. I was actually told to contact Amazon since they sold it to me. It seems like after spending a thousand dollars on Microsoft products they would at least provide a bit of tech support.  I'll just have to scour the web for a fix to this I guess. Overall I would recommend this tablet to every student. It seems to be a fantastic and fast machine.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Tom Johnston,4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7
B07YNHXX8D,New-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Touch-Screen,It is even better than you expected it to be...,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020","My previous laptop was a godzilla, 15 inch monitor, weighs like 3 pounds or something (2014 model). I was looking for something that had the horsepower for what I needed, but also the lightness to carry it around. Although battery life isnt, the best, I DON'T MIND!This thing is a beast! Im very happy running programs like tableau, zoom, excel, powerpoint, all at the same time and with various files and this thing doesn't even flinch. The first few hours setting up and downloading all the programs it felt a big sluggish and I was starting to get worried. Once that was done, it started to fly.Yes, the rotating screen isnt as flawless as apple's iPad. That said, I bought this not to look pretty, i bought it to be my tool in battle. Being able to run all the programs that a regular PC can run is the main decision I went for Microsoft Surface.  The only downside is that Microsoft is a bit costly on the accessories front.I recommend this piece of tech to anyone who needs to travel or is on the move.  I'm a relatively big guy and i've had no major problem with the size of the keyboard. I do put it FLAT on tables because my keystrokes tend to be pretty hard and the keyboard is the most (in my opinion) fragile of the accessories.Lastly, the Pen interface is not perfect YET but oh man, as a first timer working with it, it kicks total ass and makes note taking in OneNote a complete positive trip.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jaime Enrique Lopez,11 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

B07YNHXX8D,New-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Touch-Screen,Don’t buy the surface pro 7 from amazon,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2020","Well where do i start..... i ended up getting my item and everything was good for about 20mins of use... however after 20mins my screen would freeze for 10-30 secs. I blew it off at first but then it happen 10mins after then it became a often issue. So i ended up going for an exchange. (The worst idea I’ve ever had). I called up amazon and told them my issue and they were quick to get me a replacement so as first i was satisfied until the surface pro 7 came in the next day. I open the box to find out the box it comes in is not only damage but in a renewed box didn’t even come in the same box it should have come in, then i open that to see the surface pro and the screen film wrapped around it was really dirty as if they dropped it in dirt or so and fingerprints all over the machine. So at this point I’m just hoping it works. This one was not charged at all at 15% like it usually is if you were to buy from Microsoft or an apple device would normally be. So i put it on the charger to find out that it not only has screen tear straight down the middle of the screen but a big red dot half the size of the screen was on there as if they drop the surface pro. So at this point i immediately call amazon and i talked to a representative that ended up giving me a hard time about another replacement even though this one was obviously there fault. So i ended up talking to a supervisor that ended up giving me a hard time as well and in the she said to me that they only do a exchange once but as a one time exception they’ll do the exchange to which i responded with i only want to do the exchange if it’s a brand new product that they are giving me not a renewed one and undamaged. To which she agreed that she would make sure it would be done and put in her notes so the wear house  knows. Well the next day came and guess what.... the man that drops it off throws my package at the wall of my house from a big distance he didn’t see me at all so when i raced over the man jumped in his car and quickly drove away knowing what he did. Not only this but when i open the box the surface pro again was in a dirty renewed box, at this point I’m just hoping it still even worked again no power so i plug it in and guess what it works surprisingly after all that. However i Notice something was different with the boot up process so i knew something was wrong i go to the setting of the computer and the version i bought was 8gb of ram i5 model with 128gb of memory the one i receive as a replacement this time was a 4gb version i5 model with 128gb of memory and GUESS WHAT A DIFFERENT GRAPHICS CARD AS WELL. The surface pro 7 i got not only had 4gb of ram which was wrong but a different graphics card as well that comes in a surface pro 5 are you serious.... so i called up customer service again asking for a supervisor yet again..... just wanting a refund the man told me well i see here that you have a couple of exchange for this device already so i told him this story i am telling now and ask him i wonder why i have “a couple of exchanges” to which he said well instead of a refund i can get you a brand new one and told me how he had to make a couple of phone calls to do this for me so i told him this is the last exchange I’ll be getting ill be asking for a refund next like i previously wanted..if the next one comes in the renewed box which that would mean it’s used.. if it’s broken or the wrong model I’m done with trying and I’m done with the surface pro 7. not only was this the worst experience with amazon that I’ve ever had and worst costumer Service but now I’m going to hate the surface pro 7 because of this. I’ll see what i receive next as of 02/23/2020Sorry for the long review but i felt my experience should be shared for others to see.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Anthony,194 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7
B07YNHXX8D,New-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Touch-Screen,Replaced my laptop and ipad,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2021","I use this as my go to school/work laptop, as well as a drawing display. For both the surface works well, switching between modes is flawless and the pen is very responsive. I got the matte black one, and while i like the color it does chip easily, with light usage there is some chips in the paint but that is to be a expected with matte colors, they just don't hold up as well. I would not recommend getting matte black for a child or if you are a heavy user. Another thing is that the batter doesn’t last long when using the surface continuously even when on battery saver, I'm a student so there are times where i could be using it for hours at a time, pretty much after 4 hours I’ll have to plug it in. Which leads me to the charger itself, the connector is magnet based and not a real port so to speak, so its very weak. If you’re like me and you like to use laptops on the couch or in bed its going to constantly come unplugged from shifting and movement. Its very annoying i wish it was just a normal charging port. The battery and charging port are the main reasons i rate this 4/5 stars, the decision to get matte black was on me so ill take that L, but over all i do like this laptop/tablet. I don’t use this for gaming so I don’t know how it holds up there, but i cant imagine having steam, discord, and whatever other apps open and having it run just as well as a dedicated desktop, this is more of a light work laptop. As i said before i do use this for drawing and for that it does hold up well. I typically have a few chrome tabs open and a large canvas while drawing (5600x6000px 600dpi) and even when i get up to 40 layers i don't experience lag. And unless you’ve got eagle eyes, you wont notice any delay from the pen, unless you’ve got some high stabilization settings. If you’re looking to upgrade your laptop or looking to consolidate your tech, this is a great product. This totally killed my need for my ipad and runs way better than my old 2017 laptop, so much so that i ended up selling both of them.Some notes:- the pen is sold separately but i do recommend getting it if you plan on drawing or using the surface to write notes.- if you plan on getting a keyboard with it I recommend the brydge surface wireless keyboard, the hinges are strong and really make the surface feel like a laptop",4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,22 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7
B07YNHXX8D,New-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Touch-Screen,i5 10th gen /8gb RAM  / 128GB,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2019","I initially bought a Surface Go(8gb) for a gift and when I had it in my hands I fell in love with the Surface. I had to get one for myself. Since I didn't find another 8gb surface go model, I went w/ the Pro 7 i5/8gb model myself. I am in love with this device. Watching netflix is great,  Illustrator and other drawing software works great w/ the surface pen. Keyboard took a few minutes to get the hang of it and I quite enjoy it, it works well. It is a bit heavy when holding it w/ one hand (this is why I loved the Surface GO version for normal tablet use) but it is quite light overall.Also tested a few games and it actually surprised me a bit tacking into account this is the i5 model. I am able to play Halo Reach just fine, (note that I had to lower the resolution down to 1080p) and it plays good. Minecraft plays really well. I didnt actually get this for gaming ( lol ) but it plays light games just great (of course it gets warm w/ Reach). StardewValley FTW! Currently this is my primary device and it performs extremely well. If you have the extra cash, do go for the i7 model mainly for the 16gb of RAM. OS consumes around 2.5-3GB of ram, so that doesnt leave much left on the 8GB model. I personally did not have an extra 500$ just to get the i7 model.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Alfredo,35 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

I considered the Surface Pro X, because it has an option for stowing the slim pen in its keyboard but opted for the regular surface pen after trying them out in a retail store.I've deducted one star because:The large bezel. Doesn't bother me much at all, but it really doesn't stack up to competitor designs in 2019/2020. Still looks very sleek overall.Windows 10 works surprisingly well in tablet mode, but Microsoft is really missing an opportunity by not having a good built-in or Office e-reader (epub, pdf, mobi support) with pen support for document/ebook markup. Edge doesn't cut it feature-wise. Luckily there's a popular app in the Microsoft Store called Drawboard PDF that works really well. The lack of Microsoft application support for critical Surface features is another reason for deducting a star! OneNote and other apps were great on here. I'd love to try an MS designed e-reader with pen support.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Katie,7 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

This is the first time that I've used a Chromebook & absolutely love it!! Before this one I had bought one that had Micrsoft OS & hated it. Sent it back & bought the HP. The screen is excellent, very clear. The speakers could be a little better. It seems that the sound comes out of one side even though it has dual speakers beside the keyboard, so, thus not giving a true stereo sound. However, the sound is very clear which I appreciate. Now for the battery. I have NEVER had electronics like this one as far as battery life & the lightning fast charge. I am so impressed with this. I use this everyday from the time I get up until I go to bed which is more than 16 hours. When this one eventually wears out, I will definitely buy another HP.Update: Oct 15, 2023I just wanted to give an update to this. I am still so very pleased with this laptop. I'm still in awe of the speed in the charging time. However, the sound is barely noticeable, with certain shows, which has been a big disappointment for me. Therefore, I did take a star away. But I still highly recommend this as a good purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Elle57,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

We have a couple of other computers, laptops in the house for more serious-intense stuff so I wasn't looking for a powerful, heavy duty laptop.  When I'm typing (even as I type this review), periodically the letters will jump to a previous portion that I already typed and I'll have to delete and place the cursor back to end of the text and retype it in.  This happens fairly frequently.  Also, as I type, out of the blue a whole section of what I've typed will become highlighted for no reason and then it will delete itself and force me to start over.  If the older Compaq's E key and 3 weren't malfunctioning, I would have kept it.  As old as it was, it was a better, more reliable laptop.  The highlight issue I referred to above just happened and I had to stop, take my hands off the laptop and wait for it to go away.  Knowing what I know now, I would not purchase this laptop.  I would definitely have been better served by spending a little more money for a better quality product.  I'm not expecting it to last long.

B083JMDKQD,Apple-MacBook-Pro-MPTT2LL-Renewed,80% of Original Battery Life and 80% Charge Capacity are Completely Different Statements,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2022","Contacted BuySpry prior to purchasing Excellent Renewed Condition 2017 MacBook Pro 15 inch - 3.1 Ghz - 1Tb SSD - 16Gb Ram through Amazon Renewed  and confirmed via Phone Call with BuySpry Representative there was an issue with Wrong Power Adapters Being Sent Out and was told if it occurred the specific person of which whom I had an extension would make things right and make sure the correct one was shipped out.I then called the Specific BuySpry Representative I had previously spoken with and which point I was informed that the wrong power adapter shipped with the MacBook Pro  was an Amazon Problem.8-10 Hrs on the Phone with Apple Technical Support - Senior Level Advisor,  and BuySpry,  and Amazon Leads  this Past Week.Per Apple Senior Advisor within Technical Support who remotely logged into my MacBook Pro just purchased through Amazon Renewed and BuySpry the seller:  I was informed that Battery Cycle Count starts from 0 and goes up.  The Battery of this current MacBook is at 35% of Original Battery Life. Furthermore,  I was informed that Battery Cycle Count starts from 0 and goes up.This means I either have to return this one or drive 80 to 90 minutes to the Apple Store and either leave the MacBook Pro with them. Or have the Apple Store order the battery and return once the battery arrives at the store and set up a time to coordinate to have the Battery Installed.  Or have it shipped to Apple and be without my MacBook for at least 3 to 7 Business Days.Please Note: MacBook Pro Battery Replacement is $200 through Apple not including Shipping if being sent them.The cost will be $285 through a Certified Apple Service Provider as they pay the same $200 price and charge for Labor.Furthermore: 80% Charge Capacity can occur at 950 Battery Cycle Count and will only hold charge for 3 or less for example and undoubtedly requires a new battery.80% Charge Capacity can occur at 200 vs 500 vs 800 Battery cycle count which equates to Long Ability to Hold Charge vs Middle of the Road Ability to Hold Charge vs Minimal Ability to Hold Charge.At the end of the day the Seller cannot Guarantee that I will be receiving a Battery that is 80% of Original Battery Life - nor that I will receive the correct adapter.Sadly this is one of the Worst Experiences in terms of Purchase through Amazon Prime in 12+ years and as much as I would like to order from BuySpry - they themselves have shared the onus is upon Amazon's Warehouse to make sure the correct MacBooks and Adapters are being sent out to the customers which Amazon Lead/Supervisor explained is not an accurate statement.I will most likely return this MacBook Pro and find an Apple Certified Reseller that ensures new Authentic Apple Batteries are being placed in their Renewed MacBooks.Please Be Aware and Make Sure- Verify - Verify -Verify by written documentation via seller's description or Correspondence with the Seller via Amazon Messaging that  the MacBook Pro being purchased under Amazon Renewed has both 80% of Original Battery Life and Holds 80% Full Charge Capacity.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Montana Doc,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

Not the reason intended but for the price, beats most other tablets.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Michael Sutton,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,7

B095M96SXJ,Dell-Latitude-7490-Laptop-1920x1080,Fantastic affordable laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2022","Basic features:- Intel Core 8th gen i5-8350U CPU @1.70GHz (base speed; 3.60 GHz max frequency; 4 core)- 16 GB memory- 512 GB SSD- 1920 x 1080 resolution with 14” screen size- 3 USB ports- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity- Intel UHD Graphics 620- Backlit keyboardSummary: great laptop at an affordable price. It is hard to find an affordable laptop with a good processor or 16 GB memory, much less both. The item subtotal at the time of purchase was $250. Comparably, the Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-347N ($290; #11 in best-selling traditional laptops) has 8GB ram, 128 GB SSD, Intel i3-1115G4 CPU (1.70 GHz base, 4.10 max; 2 core), with the same number of resolution and USB ports. That laptop has 4.5/5 stars, and I think a similar rating should be said of this laptop.Regarding the CPU: the title suggests that the processor is an Intel 7th gen i5-7200U CPU, which is a 2-core processor with 2.50 GHz base frequency and 3.10 GHz max. This isn’t the case, as mine had a different processor (Intel 7th gen i5-8350U) as mentioned above. My understanding is that this is an upgrade, though not too big of a difference. I am also not sure where the “About this product” and “Technical details” specify that the processor is 2.5 GHz, which is neither the base speed nor the max frequency for either processor. Just something to note.Because of the display size of laptops, Windows will recommend 150% scaling meaning the 1920 x 1080 resolution will appear much smaller. Simply change the scaling to 100%.Do note that it does not come with a numeric keypad.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Myra Haverda,5 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

B0BSP4ZMGB,ASUS-Chromebook-i5-1135G7-Processor-CX5501FEA-AS562T,A strong competitor to Windows PCs in the same price range,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024","I originally purchased a Windows laptop from another brand to use in class, but I returned it because it didn't meet my expectations. When I was searching on Amazon, I saw this notebook on sale on the home page, and the price was very attractive. Even though it is pre-installed with Google ChromeOS, an operating system that I am completely unfamiliar with, I am willing to try it because of its high cost performance. The process of getting started with Chrome OS is very easy. I can do almost anything on Chrome OS that I can do using Windows in class. I can edit documents, read materials, operate forms, conduct online meetings, watch videos and listen to music. I can even play cloud games (such as XBOX Cloud Gaming and Amazon Luna) with lower latency and 60 FPS.However, it also has some shortcomings, especially for those users who want to move from Windows: First, ChromeOS does not have a Caps Lock key. If you are used to using this key, it will take a long time to adapt; I have not found how to turn off the lid wake-up function and charging wake-up function. Although the screen has a 144hz refresh rate, it cannot achieve a variable refresh rate like in Windows, which greatly reduces game battery life (2h), but daily battery life is much longer than Windows (about 6~8h). ChromeOS implements UI scaling by reducing the resolution: 125% scaling under Windows is still 1920*1080 resolution physically , while 120% scaling under ChromeOS is 1600*900 resolution physically.In short, at a special price, I got a 2-in-1, 1080p144hz, backlit keyboard, Intel-i5 processor, and 16G memory notebook for about 60% of the price of a Windows notebook with the same configuration. Other shortcomings seem tolerable. I also successfully installed a virtual machine and ran Windows 11 on it, but it was extremely inefficient so I wouldn't recommend it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,HY Wong,5 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

B0BSP4ZMGB,ASUS-Chromebook-i5-1135G7-Processor-CX5501FEA-AS562T,This is not a gaming Chromebook. But this could have been a Premium Chromebook,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024","Do not buy this with the sole intention of gaming on it. Yes it's good for cloud gaming. Yes it's good to run Android games. And yes, it's good for light Steam games if you know how to enable it. Any other device is good enough for cloud gaming. Your phone, a handheld, your blood pressure machine, etc. I notice a lot of people buying it because of its price point and expecting a little bit too much in terms of gaming in my opinion. But I solely blame the marketing for this.Ignoring the gaming aspect, this is probably the best lite productivity laptop I've owned in a while. It's one of the few Chromebooks on the market with specs that don't suck. I don't need to do anything like video or photo editing. I just needed something to carry around, connect to the internet, and get some light work done. I bought this from Amazon Warehouse in Used - Acceptable condition and it looked like it was brand spanking new.Chromebooks have earned a bad rep for its starting price point and under powered specs. But this laptop for me has changed that. Core i5 mixed with this lightweight operating system and 16GB of RAM with a (seemingly) replaceable M.2 drive ensures that I could get the most out of this purchase and it looks like the software support last until 2031. The build quality (in my opinion) is too good to be a Chromebook. It doesn't get hot but the fan is a bit loud even when there's no heavy load but that doesn't bother me. Battery life is OK. I say about 6 to 8-ish hours depending on the use case. Documents, normal web browsing, etc. Anything with video, you'll get significantly less on battery. Display is....there and that's the nicest thing I can say about it. Ghosting even with this 144hz display is an issue and is made worse when on battery (provided that you're using Energy Saver in Chrome). Keyboard is fine to type on but know that the layout is not a traditional Windows layout. You have no caps lock, scroll lock, num lock, F-keys, and no media keys. It looks like it's made with ChromeOS in mind. All the other typical keys are exactly where they are supposed to be but if you attempt to load Windows on this laptop (I heard that's possible with a workaround), you may lose functionality with the touchpad and keyboard which is a shame in my opinion in  case of the potential chance that Google may one day stop supporting ChromeOS. It would be nice if there was a way forward to load this laptop with something else in the event that something like that would happen. May never happen but you never really know.In conclusion, I love this laptop. Not because of gaming. But because it has specs that don't suck for a Chromebook. I think something like this could really set the bar for Chromebooks in general if they market it as a ""premium"" Chromebook and lower the MSRP. I would not pay the asking price of $700 for it which is why I'm glad I went through Amazon Warehouse for $316. If you can nab one for the same price or wait for another sale like during the holiday season, I can highly recommend this Chromebook 100%. Hopefully, I can say the same thing after a month or so.",4.0 out of 5 stars,F. Gowdy,12 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

It was also very quick to respond as I surfed the net.  However, things went downhill pretty quickly.  I began to get blue screens when I tried to boot up the laptop.  It would say that there was some kind of error and it would go into repair mode.  Over and over and over again. It is now September of 2021 (a mere 5 months after the purchase date) and I have already had to pay for a visit to our local PC repair shop where they had to re-install Windows.  That fixed things for about a month but then the same problems started up again.  The laptop currently goes into loops of blue screens and doesn't even open Windows.  I sit here writing this review on my old dinosaur of a Lenovo laptop which, sadly, now works better than my brand new laptop (which actually doesn't work at all since it goes straight to blue screens whenever I try to boot it up).  I sent an email to Oydisen Electronics, the sellers that I bought from, about 7 days ago and have received no response.  Oydisen Electronics, if you are reading this review, please contact me and I will consider adjusting the review accordingly.

B08NFDW4JS,Lenovo-IdeaPad-Non-Touch-Dual-Core-i3-1005G1,The hardware is from year 2019 and the RAM memory is soldered.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2022","I purchased the IdeaPad (IP) laptop because it had two interesting hardware parts:a) A solid disk NVMe characterized by working at high speed.b) An Intel Quad Core processor.It came with the latest Windows OS installed.If you check the product in the Amazon advertisement, you will note the following details:— There is no information about model.— The seller says it has 4 GB RAM but doesn’t tell you it is on board soldered hardware.— There is no information about an Ethernet port.The laptop arrived on time and in good conditions.  After charging the battery, I proceeded with the setup.The first surprise was the IP did not have an Ethernet port, which come standard in almost every computer.  It was very difficult to use my Wi-Fi, located about 3 feet from the laptop.  In the middle of the process, it got frozen and there was not a way to start from the beginning.  After some time trying to find out a solution, it came to my mind to do a hard reset.  Then I pushed the power button for some seconds and that was the method to start the process (Not a word from Lenovo, Microsoft or the seller how to do that).After finishing the setup, I wanted to register the product. I looked for the Command Prompt. At this point, I have a second surprise.  W11 did not permit to install anything because it was a Windows S laptop.  This is a very important information the seller did not show in his ad. I was lucky that there was a button to get rid of the S mode and install the CMD. With CMD, I was able to find the product serial number.The laptop comes with Lenovo Vantage software preinstalled where you can find information about the hardware, warranty and many other things.  Lenovo showed that warranty for the IP started in September 2021 and will last until November 2022.  Therefore, I would have only 4 months of warranty!  That made me suspect the laptop was used and registered many months before, but I don’t have proof.After searching information of the hardware installed, I found the Intel N5030, and the SSD were versions from year 2019.  However, the advertising said it was a “new” Lenovo Idea Pad.While working with some applications, I noticed the system did not respond and took me a long time to do simple things with very elemental applications like Paint.This is a low power laptop good for text editors, sending emails and browsing. One good thing is that it is fan-less and very compact.SummaryI am returning this laptop because:a) There is no possibility to increase the memory.b) The hardware is about 2 years old.c) The system works slowly in most of the applicationsd) It has no Ethernet port",2.0 out of 5 stars,MANUEL S.,45 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

First day was a bit frustrating as I am a very low tech person and had to figure out what I had to do to get rid of windows S and be able to use the programs I needed.  Looking back it wasn't that hard but it was stressful! The Lenovo my son bought lasted all through his college years and is now being used by his sister.

B081Q11FRB,HP-ProBook-650-G2-Bit-Multi-Language,Defective Product and Bad Customer Service,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2024","I recently had the displeasure of dealing with Olive Computers and my experience was far from satisfactory.I purchased an HP ProBook 650 G2 laptop from Olive Computers through Amazon. Upon receiving the item, it became evident that the charging port was defective. The device would charge intermittently. I returned the item to the vendor only to realize that the vendor claimed that nothing was wrong with the machine and only refunded $18.55 charging me $209 as a restocking fee for the item.I reached out to Amazon Customer Service on the matter and they in turn reached out to Olive Computers. I then received communication from Olive Computers that the item I returned was severely damaged and that it was an incorrect item returned, this is after charging me a restocking fee for the item, which didn’t make sense to me. Why charge a restocking fee if you realize that the item was not yours? I then realized that this vendor did not want to refund me for the item as they were now trying to stall the process and shifting blame. First, they said nothing was wrong with the item and charged a restocking fee, then they said it was a damaged item returned and then also claimed that the item was different from what they sold.What we see here is that they repeatedly shifted blame and refused to acknowledge their responsibility for the defective product. Instead of resolving the issue professionally, Olive Computers resorted to threatening language, implying that I was attempting fraud by seeking a refund for a damaged item. This behavior is unacceptable and reflects poorly on their business ethics.Despite my repeated attempts to reach a fair resolution, Olive Computers continues to evade accountability and fails to provide a satisfactory explanation for its actions.I also have an issue with how Amazon handled the incident. My first call to Amazon was on January 26th and I spent 30 minutes and 54 seconds on a call with them outlining the issue. They then reached out to Olive Computers to resolve the issue. Olive Computers continued to evade, so I reached out to Amazon again on Feb 4th and spent 10 minutes and 11 seconds on the phone again. They then sent an email to Olive Computers who again claimed that the item was damaged and that it wasn’t theirs and offered to return the item to me at my cost which I refused as since they were being dishonest in saying the item was not theirs, I didn’t trust them to return the item to me and I also didn’t believe that this was a proper resolution to the issue. I reached out to Amazon again on Feb 6th and spent 24 minutes and 12 seconds on the phone and the customer service representative advised that Amazon was going to file an A to Z claim on my behalf and I would hear back in 7 days, I also received an email to that effect. 7 days came and went and still no resolution, so I reached out to Amazon again on Feb 14th and spent 1 hour and 43 seconds on the phone as I asked to speak with a supervisor. He said there was no A to Z filed and since I had responded to the vendor's latest message it couldn’t be filed no but I would have to wait 24 hours. So after 24 hours, I reached out to Amazon again on Feb 16th and spent 27 minutes and 30 seconds on the phone with them. The customer service representative had issues putting in the A to Z claim and tried to walk me through the process of doing it myself which didn’t work because the item was already showing refunded. Amazon then told me they would escalate the matter to another team trained to handle these issues and I would hear from them within 7 days. I insisted that they put that in writing and an email was sent to me. After 7 days passed and no follow up I reached out to Amazon again on Feb 25th and spent 1 hour 4 minutes and 34 seconds on the phone with a supervisor who empathized with me but tried again to make a claim and then decided to again refer it to another Amazon team. To date, there is still no resolution of the issue with Amazon or Olive computers and I am now contemplating further actions.In conclusion, my experience with Olive Computers was marred by defective products, unprofessional conduct, baseless accusations, and a lack of accountability. In addition, Amazon has filed to be helpful in resolving this issue with the vendor. I strongly advise potential customers to refrain from purchasing from this vendor, as their business practices and customer service leave much to be desired.",1.0 out of 5 stars,griffiks,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

It is a remarkable value with the specs that it comes with at this amazing price point.All specs described were accurate and it was in excellent condition. This is a 5 year old dell laptop and it honestly looks as new as my 2 year old laptop.I did immediately upgrade the SSD to 1tb; OS to Win 11 Pro. This was a must for my use case, but you really don't need to for general business use.The sound from these speakers is the best I have ever heard on a laptop.I bought a battery when I ordered the laptop based on the AI generated comment feedback, but it appears that this was replaced prior to shipping.If you were in the market for a laptop and budget was $300.00 - 350.00 you cannot go wrong purchasing this device.

B08T6J8MZK,Lenovo-Thinkpad-1920x1080-Business-Thunderbolt,"Good enough for the price, I guess…","Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2023","I probably should have put this laptop thru its paces before now, and I might have actually returned it if I realized how poor the battery life was, and noticed the peculiar issue where the screen just sometimes goes black. I don’t necessarily blame the refurbishing QC, as the screen issue is intermittent - but the battery lasting barely an hour is something they should have noticed. Also; charge it all the way up, unplug it, and within a couple days you can’t even turn it on without plugging it back in - let alone try to use it on that charge. Now, it looks as good as new, physically, and has everything that it was advertised as including… but there is obviously still something wrong with it as evidenced from the screen blackouts (not power related or screen saver or anything like that) and poor, poor battery life. But since 99% of the time I’ll be using this at home; I’m okay with just leaving it plugged up all the time. So I dunno… I guess I just understand that refurbs will rarely be perfect, and I’m able to tolerate the issues mentioned due to the reduced price. Just temper your expectations - you very well could get a perfect one, but just know that both me and and friend that bought the same model on the same day both experienced some issues… his were big enough to return his, as he needed to rely on it on the road away from power.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Rubbertoe,3 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

The old Acer Chromebook powers off now whenever you insert a micro sd card. Then it needs to stay off for like 6 hours before you can use it again without it turning off after 15 seconds. I was hesitant about purchasing another Acer however after looking at many other manufacturers offerings those displays were small and blurry by comparison. I did get three years use out  of the old one without all of the update hassle and the old one had really great battery life.The new Acer 315 has a better keyboard ( with the DELETE key that was missing on the Acer 15) with a nice tactile feel.  The IPS display is great with a really wide viewing angle. The only thing I really miss using the the new Acer is I no longer have a back illuminated keyboard. That it turns out was a bigger deal than I thought. Videos play without problem. My Ethernet adapter is supported natively by the Acer and the Acer is one of the few models available with a display port out over USB C. Great for Nasa imagery that my Smart TV (that is no longer updated) refuses to display. So the Acer Chromebook is sort of pricey but has better portability, battery life, and a display that none of my Windows Laptops can compete with.

I am able to do everything I need to do for work and personal tasks. Very light and easy to walk around with. Touchscreen is a nice addition as well.My only complaint is that the Function and Ctrl keys are swapped compared to most other laptops/keyboards. I don't know why Lenovo does this. You can switch it in the BIOS but it's still weird.Overall this is a great work computer, I have not experienced any slowdown running my apps which are not too resource-intensive but not lightweight either. I definitely wouldn't recommend this for gaming or anything graphic intensive, but I do recommend it for basically anything else.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amin Ardehali,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

B07YNHXX8D,New-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Touch-Screen,Great school tablet,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2020","I really like this Surface Pro 7. It is exactly as advertised with one exception. The battery life is nowhere near what is advertised. On battery saving mode, using only Onenote for taking class notes, it lasts about 4 hours. Fortunately it charges up very quickly though. I can't see any way that I would get a full days use out of a full battery charge in any circumstance. In my case that is not very important because I am always around an outlet but if you need a tablet that will last all day away from a power source you will have a problem. The camera is good enough, not as good as the Apple camera, but I don't really use it as a camera anyway. I use mostly the 365 programs and find that it integrates these programs seamlessly. Onenote comes with the tablet and has been an amazing app for my vet school classes.  It saves my many hours of study time. My only issues are with the instability of Onenote. It closes itself down every few minutes and is very frustrating. I'm sure there is a fix for this but I'm also sure that I won't get it from Microsorft as they have a technical support team that is on par with the customer service team at the cable company. I've contacted them 3 times now and my issue is never addressed. I was actually told to contact Amazon since they sold it to me. It seems like after spending a thousand dollars on Microsoft products they would at least provide a bit of tech support.  I'll just have to scour the web for a fix to this I guess. Overall I would recommend this tablet to every student. It seems to be a fantastic and fast machine.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Tom Johnston,4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8
B07YNHXX8D,New-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Touch-Screen,It is even better than you expected it to be...,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020","My previous laptop was a godzilla, 15 inch monitor, weighs like 3 pounds or something (2014 model). I was looking for something that had the horsepower for what I needed, but also the lightness to carry it around. Although battery life isnt, the best, I DON'T MIND!This thing is a beast! Im very happy running programs like tableau, zoom, excel, powerpoint, all at the same time and with various files and this thing doesn't even flinch. The first few hours setting up and downloading all the programs it felt a big sluggish and I was starting to get worried. Once that was done, it started to fly.Yes, the rotating screen isnt as flawless as apple's iPad. That said, I bought this not to look pretty, i bought it to be my tool in battle. Being able to run all the programs that a regular PC can run is the main decision I went for Microsoft Surface.  The only downside is that Microsoft is a bit costly on the accessories front.I recommend this piece of tech to anyone who needs to travel or is on the move.  I'm a relatively big guy and i've had no major problem with the size of the keyboard. I do put it FLAT on tables because my keystrokes tend to be pretty hard and the keyboard is the most (in my opinion) fragile of the accessories.Lastly, the Pen interface is not perfect YET but oh man, as a first timer working with it, it kicks total ass and makes note taking in OneNote a complete positive trip.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jaime Enrique Lopez,11 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

B07YNHXX8D,New-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Touch-Screen,Don’t buy the surface pro 7 from amazon,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2020","Well where do i start..... i ended up getting my item and everything was good for about 20mins of use... however after 20mins my screen would freeze for 10-30 secs. I blew it off at first but then it happen 10mins after then it became a often issue. So i ended up going for an exchange. (The worst idea I’ve ever had). I called up amazon and told them my issue and they were quick to get me a replacement so as first i was satisfied until the surface pro 7 came in the next day. I open the box to find out the box it comes in is not only damage but in a renewed box didn’t even come in the same box it should have come in, then i open that to see the surface pro and the screen film wrapped around it was really dirty as if they dropped it in dirt or so and fingerprints all over the machine. So at this point I’m just hoping it works. This one was not charged at all at 15% like it usually is if you were to buy from Microsoft or an apple device would normally be. So i put it on the charger to find out that it not only has screen tear straight down the middle of the screen but a big red dot half the size of the screen was on there as if they drop the surface pro. So at this point i immediately call amazon and i talked to a representative that ended up giving me a hard time about another replacement even though this one was obviously there fault. So i ended up talking to a supervisor that ended up giving me a hard time as well and in the she said to me that they only do a exchange once but as a one time exception they’ll do the exchange to which i responded with i only want to do the exchange if it’s a brand new product that they are giving me not a renewed one and undamaged. To which she agreed that she would make sure it would be done and put in her notes so the wear house  knows. Well the next day came and guess what.... the man that drops it off throws my package at the wall of my house from a big distance he didn’t see me at all so when i raced over the man jumped in his car and quickly drove away knowing what he did. Not only this but when i open the box the surface pro again was in a dirty renewed box, at this point I’m just hoping it still even worked again no power so i plug it in and guess what it works surprisingly after all that. However i Notice something was different with the boot up process so i knew something was wrong i go to the setting of the computer and the version i bought was 8gb of ram i5 model with 128gb of memory the one i receive as a replacement this time was a 4gb version i5 model with 128gb of memory and GUESS WHAT A DIFFERENT GRAPHICS CARD AS WELL. The surface pro 7 i got not only had 4gb of ram which was wrong but a different graphics card as well that comes in a surface pro 5 are you serious.... so i called up customer service again asking for a supervisor yet again..... just wanting a refund the man told me well i see here that you have a couple of exchange for this device already so i told him this story i am telling now and ask him i wonder why i have “a couple of exchanges” to which he said well instead of a refund i can get you a brand new one and told me how he had to make a couple of phone calls to do this for me so i told him this is the last exchange I’ll be getting ill be asking for a refund next like i previously wanted..if the next one comes in the renewed box which that would mean it’s used.. if it’s broken or the wrong model I’m done with trying and I’m done with the surface pro 7. not only was this the worst experience with amazon that I’ve ever had and worst costumer Service but now I’m going to hate the surface pro 7 because of this. I’ll see what i receive next as of 02/23/2020Sorry for the long review but i felt my experience should be shared for others to see.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Anthony,194 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8
B07YNHXX8D,New-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Touch-Screen,Replaced my laptop and ipad,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2021","I use this as my go to school/work laptop, as well as a drawing display. For both the surface works well, switching between modes is flawless and the pen is very responsive. I got the matte black one, and while i like the color it does chip easily, with light usage there is some chips in the paint but that is to be a expected with matte colors, they just don't hold up as well. I would not recommend getting matte black for a child or if you are a heavy user. Another thing is that the batter doesn’t last long when using the surface continuously even when on battery saver, I'm a student so there are times where i could be using it for hours at a time, pretty much after 4 hours I’ll have to plug it in. Which leads me to the charger itself, the connector is magnet based and not a real port so to speak, so its very weak. If you’re like me and you like to use laptops on the couch or in bed its going to constantly come unplugged from shifting and movement. Its very annoying i wish it was just a normal charging port. The battery and charging port are the main reasons i rate this 4/5 stars, the decision to get matte black was on me so ill take that L, but over all i do like this laptop/tablet. I don’t use this for gaming so I don’t know how it holds up there, but i cant imagine having steam, discord, and whatever other apps open and having it run just as well as a dedicated desktop, this is more of a light work laptop. As i said before i do use this for drawing and for that it does hold up well. I typically have a few chrome tabs open and a large canvas while drawing (5600x6000px 600dpi) and even when i get up to 40 layers i don't experience lag. And unless you’ve got eagle eyes, you wont notice any delay from the pen, unless you’ve got some high stabilization settings. If you’re looking to upgrade your laptop or looking to consolidate your tech, this is a great product. This totally killed my need for my ipad and runs way better than my old 2017 laptop, so much so that i ended up selling both of them.Some notes:- the pen is sold separately but i do recommend getting it if you plan on drawing or using the surface to write notes.- if you plan on getting a keyboard with it I recommend the brydge surface wireless keyboard, the hinges are strong and really make the surface feel like a laptop",4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer,22 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8
B07YNHXX8D,New-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Touch-Screen,i5 10th gen /8gb RAM  / 128GB,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2019","I initially bought a Surface Go(8gb) for a gift and when I had it in my hands I fell in love with the Surface. I had to get one for myself. Since I didn't find another 8gb surface go model, I went w/ the Pro 7 i5/8gb model myself. I am in love with this device. Watching netflix is great,  Illustrator and other drawing software works great w/ the surface pen. Keyboard took a few minutes to get the hang of it and I quite enjoy it, it works well. It is a bit heavy when holding it w/ one hand (this is why I loved the Surface GO version for normal tablet use) but it is quite light overall.Also tested a few games and it actually surprised me a bit tacking into account this is the i5 model. I am able to play Halo Reach just fine, (note that I had to lower the resolution down to 1080p) and it plays good. Minecraft plays really well. I didnt actually get this for gaming ( lol ) but it plays light games just great (of course it gets warm w/ Reach). StardewValley FTW! Currently this is my primary device and it performs extremely well. If you have the extra cash, do go for the i7 model mainly for the 16gb of RAM. OS consumes around 2.5-3GB of ram, so that doesnt leave much left on the 8GB model. I personally did not have an extra 500$ just to get the i7 model.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Alfredo,35 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

The speeds are great. The screen fantastic. It takes my Office 365 with ease. The keyboard works great when I am not using the docking port.

I'm primarily using it as a writing tablet and e-reader for part-time grad school, and I'd like to start using it for work (engineer). It's improved my workflow a ton. The Surface Pen is great and the magnet makes for a very secure attachment. I considered the Surface Pro X, because it has an option for stowing the slim pen in its keyboard but opted for the regular surface pen after trying them out in a retail store.I've deducted one star because:The large bezel. Doesn't bother me much at all, but it really doesn't stack up to competitor designs in 2019/2020. Still looks very sleek overall.Windows 10 works surprisingly well in tablet mode, but Microsoft is really missing an opportunity by not having a good built-in or Office e-reader (epub, pdf, mobi support) with pen support for document/ebook markup. Edge doesn't cut it feature-wise. Luckily there's a popular app in the Microsoft Store called Drawboard PDF that works really well. The lack of Microsoft application support for critical Surface features is another reason for deducting a star! OneNote and other apps were great on here. I'd love to try an MS designed e-reader with pen support.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Katie,7 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

It is almost exactly like the one I purchased two years ago on Amazon that is still fully functional.  It's a great little device.  I like the backlit keyboard because it allows me to use the laptop late at night without any additional lighting source.  The sound system is great.  I can store everything I need to store.  No complaints.  I hope this one lasts as long as all the others.,5.0 out of 5 stars,SonomaRN,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8
B09886Q4PW,HP-Chromebook-Micro-Edge-Portable-14a-na0024nr,Amazing!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2023","I've had this laptop since April 2022 & never had a problem. This is the first time that I've used a Chromebook & absolutely love it!! Before this one I had bought one that had Micrsoft OS & hated it. Sent it back & bought the HP. The screen is excellent, very clear. The speakers could be a little better. It seems that the sound comes out of one side even though it has dual speakers beside the keyboard, so, thus not giving a true stereo sound. However, the sound is very clear which I appreciate. Now for the battery. I have NEVER had electronics like this one as far as battery life & the lightning fast charge. I am so impressed with this. I use this everyday from the time I get up until I go to bed which is more than 16 hours. When this one eventually wears out, I will definitely buy another HP.Update: Oct 15, 2023I just wanted to give an update to this. I am still so very pleased with this laptop. I'm still in awe of the speed in the charging time. However, the sound is barely noticeable, with certain shows, which has been a big disappointment for me. Therefore, I did take a star away. But I still highly recommend this as a good purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Elle57,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

B09479KMGB,HP-Touchscreen-Portable-Microsoft-14-dq0060nr,Meh,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2022","I bought this to replace a 12 year old Compaq laptop that was used for basic-general stuff like receiving and sending emails, Facebook, and general Internet searches.  We have a couple of other computers, laptops in the house for more serious-intense stuff so I wasn't looking for a powerful, heavy duty laptop.  When I'm typing (even as I type this review), periodically the letters will jump to a previous portion that I already typed and I'll have to delete and place the cursor back to end of the text and retype it in.  This happens fairly frequently.  Also, as I type, out of the blue a whole section of what I've typed will become highlighted for no reason and then it will delete itself and force me to start over.  If the older Compaq's E key and 3 weren't malfunctioning, I would have kept it.  As old as it was, it was a better, more reliable laptop.  The highlight issue I referred to above just happened and I had to stop, take my hands off the laptop and wait for it to go away.  Knowing what I know now, I would not purchase this laptop.  I would definitely have been better served by spending a little more money for a better quality product.  I'm not expecting it to last long.

B083JMDKQD,Apple-MacBook-Pro-MPTT2LL-Renewed,80% of Original Battery Life and 80% Charge Capacity are Completely Different Statements,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2022","Contacted BuySpry prior to purchasing Excellent Renewed Condition 2017 MacBook Pro 15 inch - 3.1 Ghz - 1Tb SSD - 16Gb Ram through Amazon Renewed  and confirmed via Phone Call with BuySpry Representative there was an issue with Wrong Power Adapters Being Sent Out and was told if it occurred the specific person of which whom I had an extension would make things right and make sure the correct one was shipped out.I then called the Specific BuySpry Representative I had previously spoken with and which point I was informed that the wrong power adapter shipped with the MacBook Pro  was an Amazon Problem.8-10 Hrs on the Phone with Apple Technical Support - Senior Level Advisor,  and BuySpry,  and Amazon Leads  this Past Week.Per Apple Senior Advisor within Technical Support who remotely logged into my MacBook Pro just purchased through Amazon Renewed and BuySpry the seller:  I was informed that Battery Cycle Count starts from 0 and goes up.  The Battery of this current MacBook is at 35% of Original Battery Life. Furthermore,  I was informed that Battery Cycle Count starts from 0 and goes up.This means I either have to return this one or drive 80 to 90 minutes to the Apple Store and either leave the MacBook Pro with them. Or have the Apple Store order the battery and return once the battery arrives at the store and set up a time to coordinate to have the Battery Installed.  Or have it shipped to Apple and be without my MacBook for at least 3 to 7 Business Days.Please Note: MacBook Pro Battery Replacement is $200 through Apple not including Shipping if being sent them.The cost will be $285 through a Certified Apple Service Provider as they pay the same $200 price and charge for Labor.Furthermore: 80% Charge Capacity can occur at 950 Battery Cycle Count and will only hold charge for 3 or less for example and undoubtedly requires a new battery.80% Charge Capacity can occur at 200 vs 500 vs 800 Battery cycle count which equates to Long Ability to Hold Charge vs Middle of the Road Ability to Hold Charge vs Minimal Ability to Hold Charge.At the end of the day the Seller cannot Guarantee that I will be receiving a Battery that is 80% of Original Battery Life - nor that I will receive the correct adapter.Sadly this is one of the Worst Experiences in terms of Purchase through Amazon Prime in 12+ years and as much as I would like to order from BuySpry - they themselves have shared the onus is upon Amazon's Warehouse to make sure the correct MacBooks and Adapters are being sent out to the customers which Amazon Lead/Supervisor explained is not an accurate statement.I will most likely return this MacBook Pro and find an Apple Certified Reseller that ensures new Authentic Apple Batteries are being placed in their Renewed MacBooks.Please Be Aware and Make Sure- Verify - Verify -Verify by written documentation via seller's description or Correspondence with the Seller via Amazon Messaging that  the MacBook Pro being purchased under Amazon Renewed has both 80% of Original Battery Life and Holds 80% Full Charge Capacity.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Montana Doc,2 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

It still didn't work properly. Multiple senior Apple experts looked at it over several weeks and ran diagnostics and said they had never seen the problem before. The battery is fine but apparently there is an issue with the charging ports that no one can understand. After 5 trips to the Apple store, my laptop still won't turn on or charge for weeks at a time.I reached out to the seller twice a while back about my experience and never got any response back - completely unacceptable.I advise people to not roll the dice with this seller, USA Macs, LLC, because God forbid if anything goes wrong with your used Apple product, they will not move to help you.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Matt,4 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

B083JMDKQD,Apple-MacBook-Pro-MPTT2LL-Renewed,A dud,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2020","I was hoping that ""verified reseller"" meant they actually put some time into inspecting the computer and making sure it works. I couldn't even boot the thing up because it isn't reading that there is a ""disk"" (hard drive). There's no way to even get it to turn on. After being on the phone with apple support for a while she told me that it's a hardware issue and I need to return it.

B08ZL7W2Q3,Dell-Latitude-7210-12-3-Touchscreen,Great little machine,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023","I thought about an iPad to have around the house to quickly look up items. I found this as an alternative. I was surprised it had a Thunderbolt 3 port that actually supports an eGPU.  Windows 11 allows for some settings that doesn’t get the CPU hot and still provides gaming on an eGPU in slightly less than high/ultra settings for most games. Not the reason intended but for the price, beats most other tablets.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Michael Sutton,One person found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8

It's definitely not the low end cheap, but really not good for much other than trivial browsing.Did have to change modules slightly to get my usb to ethernet adapter working in Linux.

I spent about 3-5 months researching and deciding which Lenovo to get because there are so many and they all are so similar but also so different.I finally went with this one as it was a really good price with a lot of storage which is hard to come by.It’s also a gaming laptop to the processing speed is so fast and able to keep up with me playing the sims and multiple expansion packs and using Cricut design space and going on the internet etc.They only downside is the poor battery life, but with all that this computer is doing it’s understandable that it doesn’t last that long. I personally don’t tend to work in remote areas that don’t have outlets, so this isn’t a problem as the cord is so long and able to reach.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Madelyn,10 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,1,8
